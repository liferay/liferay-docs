# The Segment Editor

[TOC levels=1-4]

Segmentation and Personalization in @product-ver@ also provides an editor for
defining User Segments.

1.  Go to *Site Administration* and select the site that you wish to create
    segments for.

2.  Open the *Members* section and select *Segments*.

At the top of the editor you can set the name, view the current members of the
segment as it is defined, and choose to *Save* the Segment or *Cancel* to 
discard changes.

Below that there are three main sections:

- User Properties

- Organization Properties

- Session Properties

In addition to the the various properties, there are operations and conjunctions
that you use to define criteria.

## User Properties

User Properties are user attributes that you want to capture. This is made up of
user metadata as defined in their accounts, but also contains certain group
memberships (like Roles and User Groups) as well as information like the date
the user profile was last modified.

## Organization Properties

Organization Properties is a selectable list of Organizations to include in
your Segment. They contain similar criteria to user selection, like *Name* and
*Date Modified*.

## Session Properties

Session Properties contains criteria based on the user's activity, browser, 
system  information. You can use this to target the user's device or OS, or for
activity-based criteria like if a user entered the website through a specific
campaign driven landing page. 

## Operations and Conjunctions

There are a number of different ways to evaluate properties, and different ways
that you can relate different fields. For a comprehensive list see the [Defining Segment Criteria Reference](link).
