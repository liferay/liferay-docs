# Personalization Experience Management

There is no direct location for managing all aspects of Experience 
Personalization. All the different aspects are managed from whatever you're 
personalizing. The key integration points of personalization are Content Pages
and Content Sets. You can see an overview of their personalization options 
below.

## Managing Content Page Personalization

Before you can Personalize Content Pages, you first need to [create Content Pages](user-docs-link). When you edit a Content Page, you can click on the 
*Experience* to manage the options for that page.

![Figure 1: You can add, edit, delete, or change priority for Experiences.](../../images/manage-content-page-experience.png)

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click ![Options](../../images/icon-options.ong) &rarr; *Edit* for any Content
    Page.
    
3.  Click on the *Default* Experience to manage experiences.

From here you have three options:

**![Edit](../../images/icon-edit.png)** lets you change the name or selected
Segment for the Experience.

**![Delete](../../images/icon-delete.png)** deletes the Experience.

**![Priority](../../images/icon-priority.png)** lets you change to priority of 
the Experience. If a user meets the criteria for more than one Experience, the highest ordered one is displayed.

## Managing Content Set Personalization

Managing Personalization options for Content Sets is similar. First you must 
[create Content Sets](user-guide-link) then you can personalize them. To
create a new Personalized Variation of a Content Set,

1.  Click ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit* for the
    Content Set you wish to personalize.
    
2.  Next to the content set, you will see the message "No Personalized 
    Variations yet." Click the *New Personalized Variation* button.
    
3.  Select a Segment from the next page to create a variation for that Segment.

![Figure 1: Select a Segment to create a variation for.](../../images/select-content-set-variation.png)

You can create a personalized variation for any existing Segment. Each new 
variation copies the default Content Set, but then essentially functions as its 
own Content Set after that. To edit or manage a Content Set Variation,

1.  Click on the Segment name under *Personalized Variations*.

2.  Click on ![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) and you can select
    *View Content* to preview the content in that set or *Delete* to remove it.

## Previewing User Experiences

As an administrator, when you view a page, you can preview the different 
experiences that users will have on that page.

1.  Click the [Simulation](../../images/icon-simulation.png) icon from the top
    of any page.
    
2.  Select a segment from the *Segments* selection to preview the page as a 
    member of that segment.
    
Viewing the perspective of a segment will preview for the administrator any
personalizations for Content Pages or Content Sets for that Segment.
