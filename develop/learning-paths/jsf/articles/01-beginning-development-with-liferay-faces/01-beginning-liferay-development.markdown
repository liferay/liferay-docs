# Beginning Liferay Development [](id=beginning-liferay-development)

Before you begin developing a JSF application, you'll need to install a Liferay
development environment. Although it's possible to use anything from a text
editor and command line to any Java IDE available, Liferay provides two nearly
identical development tools that provide a much easier developer experience and
aids in writing code on Liferay's platform. 

Liferay IDE is Liferay's free development environment that is based on Eclipse,
a widely used open source IDE. In fact, Liferay IDE is a plugin for Eclipse that
brings many Liferay-specific features to the table. If you'd like to use IDE and
need installation instructions, visit the
[Developing Applications with Liferay IDE](/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-apps-with-liferay-ide)
learning path. 

Furthermore, Liferay Developer Studio is available for Liferay Enterprise
Edition subscribers, or those interested in Liferay's premier development
environment. For installation instruction for Liferay Developer Studio, visit
the 
[Developing Applications with Liferay Developer Studio](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-applications-with-liferay-developer-stu)
learning path.

**Note:** To follow the JSF learning path, you must have a Liferay Portal 6.2
instance and Java 7 JDK installed.

Now that your development environment is installed, you can begin creating a
basic JSF application.
