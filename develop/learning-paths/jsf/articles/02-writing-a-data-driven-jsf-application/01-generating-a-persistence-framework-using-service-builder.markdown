# Generating a Persistence Framework Using Service Builder [](id=generating-a-persistence-framework-using-service-builder)

If you've read the MVC learning path, it goes specifically through creating a
persistence framework for the MVC version of the guestbook portlet; but could
you follow the same steps for a JSF portlet? The answer is *yes*. 

The functionality of the persistence framework for a JSF portlet works exactly
the same as an MVC portlet, meaning you can create the persistence layer the
exact same way you would with an MVC portlet using Service Builder. 

For your JSF portlet, you can complete the
[Using Service Builder to Generate a Persistence Framework](/develop/learning-paths/mvc/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-service-builder-to-generate-a-persistence-fr)
learning path to successfully generate your persistence framework. Once you've
finished generating your persistence layer, return back to this point and
continue on to the next section to learn how to integrate the persistence
framework into your JSF portlet.
