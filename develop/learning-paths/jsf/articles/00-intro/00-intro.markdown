# Writing a JSF Application Using Liferay Faces [](id=writing-a-jsf-application-using-liferay-faces)

If you're just getting started with Liferay Faces development, you've come to
the right place. This learning path starts with creating a JSF portlet and
drives down the path of useful JSF features, exploring how each feature is
implemented in a Liferay portlet. You'll begin by creating your own JSF portlet
from scratch, deploying it, and developing it into a Guestbook portlet. 

Before beginning, make sure you have a Liferay development environment
installed. You can learn how to install Liferay IDE or Liferay Developer Studio
in the [Beginning Liferay Development](/develop/learning-paths/jsf/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development)
learning path. Though you can use the command line or any Java IDE that's
available, Liferay provides these development tools, which make it much easier
to write code on Liferay's platform. You'll use it throughout the development
process for the JSF Guestbook portlet. 

Besides developing a JSF application from scratch, you'll learn about the
Liferay Faces initiative and Liferay Faces sub-projects like *Liferay Faces
Alloy*, *Liferay Faces Bridge*, and *Liferay Faces Portal*. You'll discover just
how easy and useful Liferay Faces makes deploying plugins to Liferay Portal.
