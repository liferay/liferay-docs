# Adding a Portlet to the Control Panel [](id=adding-a-portlet-to-the-control-panel)

Up to this point, you've created a fully-functional, data-driven JSF application
using Service Builder. You've also created managed beans and JSF views to
enhance your portlet's functionality and UI experience. Lastly, you've
implemented a permissions scheme using wrapper classes, and then created action
buttons to take advantage of those permissions. 

However, you're missing some functionality. You have no way to delete
guestbooks. There's also no way to edit them or configure a guestbook's
permissions. You'll add this functionality to your Guestbook portlet by creating
a new portlet in your portlet project that can be accessed through the Control
Panel. This will be used by administrators to add, delete, modify, and control
permissions of guestbooks that are displayed in your JSF Guestbook portlet. 

![Figure 1: In this learning path, you'll migrate your administrative guestbook functionalities to a new Guestbook Admin portlet.](../../images/guestbook-admin.png)

After this learning path, adding, editing, deleting, and controlling permissions
of guestbook entities will all be available exclusively from the new Guestbook
Admin portlet in the Control Panel.
