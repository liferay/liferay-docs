# Leveraging Bootstrap and Font Awesome Icons in Your Theme

The puzzle pieces are falling into place. You've built the theme, imported 
resources, and customized the look and feel of it with CSS. Now you'll learn how 
to use the icons that come bundled with Liferay to create the social media links 
for the Lunar Resort.

Bootstrap and Font Awesome icons come bundled with Liferay, making them a prime
resource to use in your theme. Each library of icons offers a unique sampling to 
choose from. In either case, you access the icons by setting your element's 
class to the corresponding icon name.

All of the available Bootstrap icons, along with their names, can be found in 
the [Github repository](http://liferay.github.io/alloy-bootstrap/base-css.html#icons).

Likewise, you will find the list of available Font Awesome icons, along with
their names, in their [Github repository](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/3.2.1/icons/).

In this portion of the Learning Path, you'll leverage some of Font Awesome's
icons to create the social media links for the Lunar Resort, but you could use 
Bootstrap's icons using the same methods.
