Put sample code in folders that map to the article and section to which it is related.

For example, add the following folders for sample plugins that demonstrate using the User and Organization APIs:

- `platform/` - Note that the folder has no number prefix, unlike its related article Markdown file. 
    - `users-and-organizations/`
        - `sample-01/`
            - `some-portlet/`
                ...
        - `[sample-02/]`
            - `some-portlet/`
                ...
