# Building the Liferay Mobile SDK

Once you've deployed the Guestbook portlet to your Liferay instance, you're 
ready to build the Liferay Mobile SDK. You might be asking yourself, "Why do I 
have to build it? Can't I just use the pre-built Mobile SDK that Liferay already 
provides?" Fantastic question! The reason is that the pre-built Mobile SDK 
provided by Liferay only includes classes for calling the remote services of 
Liferay's *core* portlets. Core portlets are the portlets included with every 
Liferay installation (also referred to as *out-of-the-box* portlets). Since this 
learning path calls the remote services of the Guestbook portlet developed in 
the [Liferay MVC learning path](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development), 
you have to build the Mobile SDK. This is the case with any non-core portlet: 
you must build the Liferay Mobile SDK if you want to use it to call your 
portlet's remote services. Now it's time to get building! 

## Building the Mobile SDK

For the Mobile SDK Builder to generate the classes that can call a non-core
portlet's remote services, those services must be available and accompanied by a
Web Service Deployment Descriptor (WSDD). To learn how the Guestbook portlet's
remote services and WSDD were generated, please see the
[Creating Web Services for Your Application](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/creating-web-services-for-your-application)
learning path. Since web services have already been generated for the Guestbook
portlet that you're using in this learning path, you don't need to take this
step here. Just remember that you need to generate web services when developing
your own portlets.

To build the Mobile SDK, you first need to download its source code. You can do 
so by clicking [this link](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/archive/android-6.2.0.15.zip). 
Unzip the ZIP file to a location on your machine where you want the Mobile SDK 
to reside. This is purely personal preference; it works the same regardless of 
where it is. Once unzipped, the source code for this version of the Mobile SDK 
is in the `liferay-mobile-sdk-android-6.2.0.15` folder. Now you're ready to 
build a Mobile SDK for the Guestbook portlet! The Mobile SDK contains a 
convenient command line wizard for helping you with this step. To start it, 
navigate to the `liferay-mobile-sdk-android-6.2.0.15` directory and issue the 
following command:

    ./gradlew createModule

The wizard launches and then asks you to enter some properties for your project. 
You're first asked to provide the project's `Context` property. This needs to be 
set to the context path of the Guestbook portlet's remote services. To view the 
available remote service context paths for your portal, navigate to 
[http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws](http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws). On the 
page's upper left, there's a menu for selecting the context path. Select 
*guestbook-portlet*. The UI updates to show only the remote services available 
in the selected context path.

The Mobile SDK Builder needs this value so that it knows what remote services to 
generate classes and methods for. Return to the terminal and enter 
`guestbook-portlet` for the `Context` property.

Next, you're asked for the build's `Package Name` property. This is the package 
path for the classes generated by the Mobile SDK Builder. Accept the default 
value of `com.liferay.mobile.android`. The last property the Mobile SDK Builder 
asks for is the `POM Description`. Technically, this is only needed if you're 
planning to publish your generated Mobile SDK to Maven. However, since it's 
required for the build to run, enter `Guestbook Portlet SDK`. The following 
screenshot shows the `Context`, `Package Name`, and `POM Description` properties 
entered in the Mobile SDK Builder: 

![Figure 2: The command line wizard for building the Mobile SDK.](../../images/mobile-sdk-build-wizard.png)

Once you enter the final property, the Mobile SDK Builder runs and generates a 
`BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. Great! However, you're probably wondering what just 
happened. Obviously, the build completed successfully, but other than that it 
doesn't tell you much. What happened is this: the Mobile SDK Builder generated 
the source classes you'll use in your Android app to interact with your Liferay 
installation's Guestbook portlet. You can find these source classes in the 
following directory of your `liferay-mobile-sdk-android-6.2.0.15` directory: 

    modules/guestbook-portlet/android/src/gen/java

You should also note that the source classes are in the package path you 
specified during the build, with an additional directory that denotes the 
Liferay version. Therefore, the full path to the generated source classes is:

    modules/guestbook-portlet/android/src/gen/java/com/liferay/mobile/android/v62

This directory has two subdirectories that correspond to each entity in the 
Guestbook portlet: `guestbook` and `entry`. In them, you'll find the respective 
source class for each, `EntryService.java` and `GuestbookService.java`. There's 
just one last thing to take care of before you can use these classes in your 
Android app: put them in a `jar` file. 

To do this, navigate to the `modules/guestbook-portlet` directory on the command 
line and run `../../gradlew jar`. This command does two things: 

1. Generates a `jar` file with the Guestbook portlet's service classes. This is
   in `modules/guestbook-portlet/build/libs`.

2. Generates a `jar` file for the rest of the Mobile SDK. This is in
   `liferay-mobile-sdk-android-6.2.0.15/android/build/libs`.

Congratulations! You just built the Liferay Mobile SDK for the Guestbook 
portlet. Now that's an accomplishment worthy of writing down in a guestbook! All 
you need now is an Android app in which to install the Mobile SDK. The next
article in this learning path shows you how to create this app.
