# Using AlloyUI in your Application [](id=using-alloy-ui-in-your-application)

AlloyUI is Liferay's user interface framework. While you can use any framework
to develop a user interface for your application, AlloyUI is an excellent choice
since it's already used by the portal. Using AlloyUI minimizes the amount of
extra JavaScript code that you need to add to your application. This, in turn,
minimizes the impact your application has on page load time. AlloyUI is an
easy-to-use framework with a uniform API that's based on YUI. Since Liferay is
already using AlloyUI, choosing AlloyUI for your application allows your
application's look and feel to closely match Liferay's styling mechanisms. For

In earlier learning paths, you created a Guestbook application, used Service
Builder to generate a data model along with service and persistence layers,
integrated your application with Liferay's permission system, implemented
portlet actions, and a created a user interface for your application. You also
created a Guestbook Admin Control Panel portlet, implemented search and indexing
for your application, and integrated your application with Liferay's asset
framework. In this learning path, you'll explore a few AlloyUI modules and learn
how to use AlloyUI to implement form validation. You'll also learn how to use
AlloyUI to handle events and manipulate DOM nodes. You'll continue the user
interface development of the Guestbook application in this learning path.
