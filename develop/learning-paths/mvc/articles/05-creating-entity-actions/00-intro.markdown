# Creating Entity Actions [](id=creating-entity-actions)

So far, you've created a Guestbook application that uses a database to store its
entries. This application is integrated with Liferay's permissions mechanism,
allowing you to control who has access to different parts of your application.
But what about managing the entries themselves? So far, there's no way to
modify, delete, or set permissions on individual guestbook entries. 

In this learning path, you'll learn how to use more features of many of the
concepts you've already been introduced to. You'll create new portlet actions
for updating guestbook entries, deleting entries, and setting permissions for
entries, along with the user interface elements to trigger them. In this way,
you'll give your users total control over their own guestbook entries.
