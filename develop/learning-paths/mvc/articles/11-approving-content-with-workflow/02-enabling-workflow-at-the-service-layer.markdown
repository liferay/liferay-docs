# Enabling Workflow at the Service Layer [](id=enabling-workflow-at-the-service-layer)

In the Learning Path on assets, you learned that asset enabled entities are
added to the `AssetEntry` table. There's no special table for workflow entities,
but there are some additional database columns in the entity table (e.g.,
`GB_Entry`) that allow you to keep track of workflow status. The necessary
fields include `status`, `statusByUserName`, `statusByUserId`, and `statusDate`.
Add the columns to the database by entering the following `<column>` tags into
`docroot/WEB-INF/service.xml`, in the Audit Fields section of both entities:

    <column name="status" type="int" />
    <column name="statusByUserId" type="long" />
    <column name="statusByUserName" type="String" />
    <column name="statusDate" type="Date" />

Once you run Service Builder, the database tables for both entities contain the
proper fields for workflow. However, if you add an `Entry`, you'll see that the
new fields are not populated. The local service implementation classes need
some modifications to put values in these fields. 

## Setting the Workflow Fields in EntryLocalServiceImpl [](id=setting-the-workflow-fields-in-entrylocalserviceimpl)

Open `EntryLocalServiceImpl` and add the following line in the
`updateEntry` method, immediately following the current setter methods
(e.g., `entry.setMessage(message)`):

    entry.setStatus(WorkflowConstants.STATUS_DRAFT);

This manually sets the status of the workflow as a draft; in the `GB_Entry`
database table, you'll now see the `status` field of an added `Entry` with the
value `2`. But you still haven't set the rest of the values.

Still in the `updateEntry` method, place the following code right before
the `return` statement:

    WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil.startWorkflowInstance(entry.getCompanyId(), 
				entry.getGroupId(), entry.getUserId(), Entry.class.getName(), 
				entry.getPrimaryKey(), entry, serviceContext);

Add these imports:

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil;

The call to `startWorkflowInstance` detects whether workflow is installed and
enabled. If it isn't, the added entity is automatically marked as approved. The
`startWorkflowInstance` also calls your `EntryWorkflowHandler` class, which
you'll create later in this Learning Path. The service layer must also update
the workflow status fields you added to `service.xml`. For this purpose, add the
following method to the bottom of `EntryLocalServiceImpl`:

     public Entry updateStatus(long userId, long guestbookId, long entryId, int status,
			ServiceContext serviceContext) throws PortalException,
			SystemException {

		User user = userLocalService.getUser(userId);
		Entry entry = getEntry(entryId);

		entry.setStatus(status);
		entry.setStatusByUserId(userId);
		entry.setStatusByUserName(user.getFullName());
		entry.setStatusDate(new Date());

		entryPersistence.update(entry);

		if (status == WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED) {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Entry.class.getName(),
					entryId, true);

		} else {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Entry.class.getName(),
					entryId, false);
		}

		return entry;
	}

Run Service Builder.

The `updateStatus` method is responsible for setting the status fields, then
persisting the information to the database. The `if` block checks the entity's
workflow status and does one of two things:

- If the entity has an approved status, it is marked as visible and can be
  displayed in the Asset Publisher portlet.
- If the entity is not approved, it is marked as not visible and can't be
  displayed in the Asset Publisher portlet.

## Setting the Workflow Fields in GuestbookLocalServiceImpl [](id=setting-the-workflow-fields-in-guestbooklocalserviceimpl)

You need to repeat the above steps to enable the service layer of the
`Guestbook` entity to set the necessary status fields needed for workflow.
Open `GuestbookLocalServiceImpl` and add the following line in the
`addGuestbook` method, immediately after the current setter methods (e.g.,
`guestbook.setExpandoBridgeAttributes(serviceContext)`):

    guestbook.setStatus(WorkflowConstants.STATUS_DRAFT);

Still in the `updateEntry` method, place the following code right before
the `return` statement:

    WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil.startWorkflowInstance(guestbook.getCompanyId(), 
				guestbook.getGroupId(), guestbook.getUserId(), Guestbook.class.getName(), 
				guestbook.getPrimaryKey(), guestbook, serviceContext);

Add these imports:

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil;

The `startWorkflowInstance` calls the `GuestbookWorkflowHandler` class that you
created in the previous step. 

The service layer must be able to update the workflow status fields you added to
`Guestbook` entity's database table. Add the following method to the bottom of
`GuestbookLocalServiceImpl`:

     public Guestbook updateStatus(long userId, long guestbookId, int status,
			ServiceContext serviceContext) throws PortalException,
			SystemException {

		User user = userLocalService.getUser(userId);
		Guestbook guestbook = getGuestbook(guestbookId);

		guestbook.setStatus(status);
		guestbook.setStatusByUserId(userId);
		guestbook.setStatusByUserName(user.getFullName());
		guestbook.setStatusDate(new Date());

		entryPersistence.update(entry);

		if (status == WorkflowConstants.STATUS_APPROVED) {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Guestbook.class.getName(),
					guestbookId, true);

		} else {

			assetEntryLocalService.updateVisible(Guestbook.class.getName(),
					guestbookId, false);
		}

		return guestbook;
	}

Run Service Builder after saving the changes you made.

Now you're almost done. The status fields can be set appropriately and
persisted to the database. If you test the workflow by adding an `Entry` to one
of the Guestbooks, your portal's administrative user receives a
notification for reviewing the submission. The entity, however, is still visible
in the portlet's search container! Why even bother having a review process if
the entity gets published anyway? Taking workflow status into account while
displaying entities in the Guestbook Portlet is the final task of this Learning
Path.
