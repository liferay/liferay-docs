# Migrating a Theme to Liferay 7

In this portion of the Learning Path, you'll migrate the lunar resort theme
from the [Liferay 6.2 Themes Learning Path](/develop/learning-paths/themes/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-a-liferay-theme) 
to Liferay 7. You'll learn how to use the [themes generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/themes-generator) 
to import and upgrade themes. You'll apply the [breaking changes](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/what-are-the-breaking-changes-for-liferay-7-0) 
to the FreeMarker theme templates. Finally, you'll upgrade the resources 
importer files and directory structure to match the new new pattern.

<!--for now I have left the guestbook portlet and make no mention of it since it 
is not updated AFAIK. Once it has been updated, it can be added to this section 
as part of the Learning Path, if desired.-->

To get started, create a folder called *resources* and 
[download the 6.2 lunar resort theme and
resources]<!--URL needs updated and theme files in temp documents placeholder folder need to be zipped(/documents/10184/581742/lunar-resort-theme-migration-6.2.zip)-->
into it. Note that the example lunar resort theme has been slightly modfied for 
this Learning Path. Follow the [themes generator tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/themes-generator) 
to install the tools you'll need for this portion of the Learning Path.

Now you can go ahead and jump right into importing the theme!
