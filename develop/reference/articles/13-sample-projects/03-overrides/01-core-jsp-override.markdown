# Core JSP Override [](id=core-jsp-hook)

## What does this sample do when it's deployed? [](id=what-does-this-sample-do-when-its-deployed)

The Core JSP Override sample lets you override core/kernel JSPs by adding them
to the module's `META-INF/jsps` folder. This module overrides the @product@'s
`bottom.jsp` file by inserting the `bottom-ext.jsp` file in the
`META-INF/jsps/html/common/themes` folder. When deploying this sample with no
customizations, sample text is added to the bottom of Liferay's default theme.

tutorial.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample leverages the
[CustomJspBag](portal-ref/portal-impl/com/liferay/portal/deploy/hot/CustomJspBag.html)
API.

**Important:** Using core JSP overrides should be a last resort option only when
there is no other way to customize functionality in your Liferay installation.
It's up to the maintainer of this JSP override to properly maintain and adapt to
changes in the underlying JSP implementation.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

You can easily modify this sample by customizing its
`com.liferay.blade.samples.corejsphook.BladeCustomJspBag` Java class or adding
additional JSPs in the configured JSP folder. You can modify the custom JSP
folder's path by editing the `BladeCustomJspBag.getCustomJspDir()` method to
return a different folder path.

For more information on customizing the Core JSP Override sample to fit your
needs, see the Javadoc listed in this sample's `BladeCustomJspBag` class.
