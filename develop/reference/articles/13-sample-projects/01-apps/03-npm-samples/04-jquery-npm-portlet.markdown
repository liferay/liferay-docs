# jQuery npm Portlet [](id=jquery-npm-portlet)

The jQuery npm Portlet sample provides a portlet that uses the
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) framework to render its output.

![Figure 1: Clicking on the portlet's hand symbol displays a message.](../../../../images/jquery-npm-sample.png)

This portlet showcases the fast HTML document traversal jQuery offers.

**Note:** The minifier fails on Liferay DXP 7.0 when JSDoc is present in a 
portlet. To resolve this, use 
[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) 
[uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) 
to remove the JSDoc comments. This process may take a long time, depending on 
the number of files that require an update.

**Important:** This sample works for Liferay DXP Fix Pack 44+ and Liferay Portal
CE GA7+.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample leverages the
[npm development workflow support](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-npm-in-your-portlets).

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

This sample uses the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) to download project
dependencies and uses the
[liferay-npm-bundler tool](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler)
to bundle the project dependencies inside the OSGi bundle JAR file.

To accomplish the bundling, the project's build process relies on a `build`
script inside its `package.json` file:

    "scripts": {
        "build": "babel --source-maps -d build/resources/main/META-INF/resources src/main/resources/META-INF/resources && liferay-npm-bundler"
    },

<!--
There are three different versions of this sample, each built with a different
