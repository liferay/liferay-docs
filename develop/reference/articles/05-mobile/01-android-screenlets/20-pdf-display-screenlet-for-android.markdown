## Features [](id=features)

PDF Display Screenlet displays a PDF file from a Liferay Instance's Documents 
and Media Library. 

## JSON Services Used [](id=json-services-used)

Screenlets in Liferay Screens call JSON web services in the portal. This 
Screenlet calls the following services and methods.

| Service | Method | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ----- |
| `ScreensassetentryService` (Screens compatibility plugin) | `getAssetEntry` | With `entryId` |
| `ScreensassetentryService` (Screens compatibility plugin) | `getAssetEntry` | With `classPK` and `className` |
| `ScreensassetentryService` (Screens compatibility plugin) | `getAssetEntries` | With `entryQuery` |
| `ScreensassetentryService` (Screens compatibility plugin) | `getAssetEntries` | With `companyId`, `groupId`, and `portletItemName` |

## Module [](id=module)

- None

## Views [](id=views)

- Default

The Default View uses Android's `PdfRenderer` to display the PDF. Note that 
`PdfRenderer` requires an Android API level of 21 or higher.

## Offline [](id=offline)

This Screenlet supports offline mode so it can function without a network 
connection. For more information on how offline mode works, see the 
[tutorial on its architecture](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/architecture-of-offline-mode-in-liferay-screens). 
Here are the offline mode policies that you can use with this Screenlet: 

| Policy | What happens | When to use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `REMOTE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. If the Screenlet successfully loads the data, it stores it in the local cache for later use. | Use this policy when you always need to show updated data, and show nothing when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_ONLY` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy when you always need to show local data, without retrieving remote information under any circumstance. |
| `REMOTE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the data from the Liferay instance. If this succeeds, the Screenlet shows the data to the user and stores it in the local cache for later use. If a connection issue occurs, the Screenlet retrieves the data from the local cache. If the data doesn't exist there, the Screenlet uses the listener to notify the developer about the error. | Use this policy to show the most recent version of the data when connected, but show an outdated version when there's no connection. |
| `CACHE_FIRST` | The Screenlet loads the data from the local cache. If the data isn't there, the Screenlet requests it from the Liferay instance and notifies the developer about any errors that occur (including connectivity errors). | Use this policy to save bandwidth and loading time in case you have local (but probably outdated) data. |

## Required Attributes [](id=required-attributes)

- `entryId` or `classPK`

## Attributes [](id=attributes)

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `layoutId` | `@layout` | The layout to use to show the View. |
| `autoLoad` | `boolean` | Whether the PDF automatically loads when the Screenlet appears in the app's UI. The default value is `true`. |
| `entryId` | `number` | The primary key of the PDF file. | 
| `classPK` | `number` | The PDF file's unique identifier. |
| `cachePolicy` | `string` | The offline mode setting. See [the Offline section](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/pdf-display-screenlet-for-android#offline) for details. |

## Listener [](id=listener)

Because PDF files are assets, PDF Display Screenlet delegates its events to a 
class that implements `AssetDisplayListener`. This interface lets you implement 
the following methods: 

- `onRetrieveAssetSuccess(AssetEntry assetEntry)`: Called when the Screenlet 
  successfully loads the PDF file. 

- `error(Exception e, String userAction)`: Called when an error occurs in the 
  process. The `userAction` argument distinguishes the specific action in which 
  the error occurred.
