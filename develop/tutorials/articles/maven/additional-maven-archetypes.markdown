# Developing Liferay Plugins with Additional Maven Archetypes [](id=developing-liferay-plugins-with-additional-maven-ar-lp-6-2-develop-tutorial)

Liferay provides more archetypes than just the ones for portlets, hooks, themes,
and layout templates. The Liferay team has been busy expanding the list of
archetypes available for Liferay app development. 

Check out these exciting archetypes that are available: 

- Liferay ServiceBuilder portlets 
- Liferay web plugins
- Liferay Ext plugins
- JSF Portlet Archetype 
- ICEFaces Portlet Archetype 
- PrimeFaces Portlet Archetype 
- Liferay Faces Alloy Portlet Archetype 
- Liferay Rich Faces Portlet Archetype 

In addition, there are some Maven *goals* Liferay has provided: 

- DBBuilder - The `build-db` goal lets you execute the DBBuilder to generate SQL
  files. 
- SassToCSSBuilder - The `build-css` goal precompiles SASS in your css; this
  goal has been added to theme archetype. 

You now have plenty of archetypes at your disposal! 

If you've been following our story that's dispersed throughout our Maven
tutorials, you might be concerned for the cat we introduced, Lenore II. Alas,
your concern is warranted. I'll let Edgar Allen Poe (from The Raven) break the
news to you:

"But the chair whose violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
Lenore II shall press, ah, nevermore!"

Lenore II didn't make it through all of the Liferay Maven tutorials, but you
did. You can develop all your Liferay plugins using Maven; there's a standard
process for generating the archetypes and selecting your plugin options for each
plugin type. You can then customize the archetype to your liking. Using Maven to
develop plugins offers an easy and effective way to customize your Liferay
Portal. 

Are you wondering if we're going to make more terrible jokes that steal from
classic poetry? Quoth the Maven, "Probably."

You're ready to create all kinds of Liferay plugins based on Liferay's plugin
archetypes. Just don't let Lenore III sleep near the fire this time.

Feeling confused by the number of features provided by Eclipse and Liferay IDE?
You can easily come across difficult questions and run into very specific
problems, but someone else might have already solved your issue or answered your
question. So where would you go to find out? Don't reinvent the wheel, visit the
[Liferay IDE Community page](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-ide/overview)!
On the *Forums* page, you can look up solutions to specific issues and ask
questions. Be sure to fully describe any problems you have to ensure you get a
working answer. You can even track known issues from the *Issue Tracker* page.
