# MVC Resource Command [](id=mvc-resource-command)

When using Liferay's MVC framework, you can create resource URLs in your JSPs to 
retrieve images, XML, or any other kind of resource from a Liferay instance. The 
resource URL then invokes the corresponding MVC resource command class 
(`*MVCResourceCommand`) that processes the resource request and response. 

First, use the `<portlet:resourceURL>` tag to create the resource URL in a JSP. 
For example, the Login Portlet's 
[`create_account.jsp` file](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/foundation/login/login-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/create_account.jsp) 
defines the following resource URL for retrieving a CAPTCHA image during account 
creation: 

    <portlet:resourceURL id="/login/captcha" var="captchaURL" />

When the resource URL is triggered, the matching `*MVCResourceCommand` class 
processes the resource request and response. You can create this class by 
implementing the 
[`MVCResourceCommand` interface](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/portlet/bridges/mvc/MVCResourceCommand.html), 
or extending the 
[`BaseMVCResourceCommand` class](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/portlet/bridges/mvc/BaseMVCResourceCommand.html). 
The latter may save you time, since it already implements `MVCResourceCommand`. 

Also, it's a good idea to name your `*MVCResourceCommand` class after the
resource it handles, and suffix it with `MVCResourceCommand`. For example, the
resource command class matching the preceding CAPTCHA resource URL in the Login
Portlet is `CaptchaMVCResourceCommand`. In an application with several MVC
command classes, this will help differentiate them.

Your `*MVCResourceCommand` class must also have a `@Component` annotation like 
the following. Set the property `javax.portlet.name` to your portlet's internal 
ID, and the property `mvc.command.name` to the value of the `id` property in 
your JSP's matching `resourceURL`. To register the component in the OSGi 
container as using the `MVCResourceCommand` class, you must set the `service` 
property to `MVCResourceCommand.class`: 

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        property = {
            "javax.portlet.name=your_portlet_name_YourPortlet",
            "mvc.command.name=/your/jsp/resource/url"
        },
        service = MVCResourceCommand.class
    )
    public class YourMVCResourceCommand implements MVCResourceCommand {
        // your resource handling code
    }

As a real-world example, consider the Login Portlet's 
[`CaptchaMVCResourceCommand` class](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/master/modules/apps/foundation/login/login-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/login/web/internal/portlet/action/CaptchaMVCResourceCommand.java): 

    @Component(
        property = {
            "javax.portlet.name=" + LoginPortletKeys.FAST_LOGIN,
            "javax.portlet.name=" + LoginPortletKeys.LOGIN,
            "mvc.command.name=/login/captcha"
        },
        service = MVCResourceCommand.class
    )
    public class CaptchaMVCResourceCommand implements MVCResourceCommand {

        @Override
        public boolean serveResource(
            ResourceRequest resourceRequest, ResourceResponse resourceResponse) {
            
            try {
                CaptchaUtil.serveImage(resourceRequest, resourceResponse);

                return false;
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                _log.error(e, e);
                
                return true;
            }
        }

        private static final Log _log = LogFactoryUtil.getLog(
            CaptchaMVCResourceCommand.class);
    }

In the `@Component` annotation, note that `javax.portlet.name` has two different 
settings. This lets multiple portlets use the same component. In this example, 
the portlet IDs are defined as constants in the `LoginPortletKeys` class. Also 
note that the `mvc.command.name` property setting `/login/captcha` matches the 
`resourceURL`'s `id` setting shown earlier in this tutorial, and that the 
`service` property is set to `MVCResourceCommand.class`. 

The `CaptchaMVCResourceCommand` class implements the `MVCResourceCommand` 
interface with only a single method: `serveResource`. This method processes the 
resource request and response via the `ResourceRequest` and `ResourceResponse` 
parameters, respectively. Note that the `try` block uses the helper class 
`CaptchaUtil` to serve the CAPTCHA image. Though you don't have to create such a 
helper class, doing so often simplifies your code. 

Great! Now you know how to use `MVCResourceCommand` to process resources in your 
Liferay MVC portlets.
