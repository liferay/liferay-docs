# Using ES2015 Modules in your Portlet [](id=using-es2015-modules-in-your-portlet)

Once you've [exposed your modules](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/preparing-your-javascript-files-for-es2015)
via your `package.json` file, you can use them in your portlets. The `aui:script`
tag's `require` attribute makes it easy.

This tutorial covers how to access in your portlets the modules you've exposed.
The example module `logger.es` was written inside the
[Console Logger Portlet](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/7.0.x/develop/tutorials/code/osgi/modules/console-logger-portlet).
Once the portlet is deployed, and added to a page, you'll notice a printout in
the console.

Follow the steps below to use your exposed modules in your portlets.

1. Declare the `aui` taglib in a JSP in your view:

        <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/aui" prefix="aui" %>

    **Note:** if you created the portlet using Blade, the `aui` taglib is
    already provided for you in the `init.jsp`.

2.  Add an `aui:script` tag to the JSP and set the `require` attribute to the
    relative path for your module.

    Since @product-ver@, the `require` attribute allows you to include your exposed
    modules in your JSP. The AMD Loader fetches the specified module and its
    dependencies. For example, the Console Logger Portlet's `view.jsp` includes
    the module `logger.es`:

        <aui:script require="js-logger/logger.es">
            var Logger = jsLoggerLoggerEs.default;

            var loggerOne = new Logger('*** -> ');
            loggerOne.log('Hello');

            var loggerDefault = new Logger();
            loggerDefault.log('World');
        </aui:script>

    References to the module within the script tag are named after the `require`
    value, in camel-case and with all invalid characters removed. The
    `logger.es` module's reference `jsLoggerLoggerEs` is derived from
    the module's relative path value `js-logger/logger.es`. The value
    is stripped of its dash and slash characters and converted to camel case.

Thanks to the `aui:script` tag and its `require` attribute, using your modules
in your portlet is a piece of cake!
