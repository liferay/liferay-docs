# Applying Lexicon Styles to your App [](id=applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps.
@product@'s built-in apps achieve this through Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://v1.lexicondesign.io/) and its web 
implementation, 
[Lexicon](https://lexiconcss.wedeploy.io/).

Lexicon provides a consistent, user-friendly UI for @product@ apps, and is
included in all themes that are based on the `_styled` base theme, making all
the components documented on the 
[Lexicon site](https://lexiconcss.wedeploy.io/)
accessible.

This means you can use Lexicon markup and components in your @product@ apps.
These tutorials explain how to apply Lexicon's design patterns to achieve the
same look and feel as @product@'s built-in apps. 

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Configuring your portlet title and back link
- Applying Lexicon patterns to your forms, navigation, and more
- Using the Add Button pattern
- Implementing the Management Bar
- Configuring your admin app's actions menu
- Setting search container animations
- Using Lexicon icons in your app
