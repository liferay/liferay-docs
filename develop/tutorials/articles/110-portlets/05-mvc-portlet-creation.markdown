# Creating an MVC Portlet [](id=creating-an-mvc-portlet)

You're convinced that Liferay's MVC Framework is right for you, and you want to learn how to configure it.

You'll need:

-  A module that publishes a portlet component with the necessary properties.
-  Controller code to handle the request and response.
-  JSPs to implement your view layer.

Along the way you'll want to know how to call services from your controller and
how to pass information from the view layer to the controller.

Keep in mind that you can take two paths with your Liferay MVC portlet
implementation. If you have a small application that won't be heavy on
controller logic (maybe just a couple of action methods), you can put all your
controller code in the `-Portlet` class. If you have more complex
needs (lots of actions, complex render logic to implement, or maybe even some
resource serving code), consider breaking the
controller into [MVC Action Command classes](develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-action-command), [MVC Render Command classes](develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-render-command), and [MVC Resource Command classes](develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-resource-command). 

In this tutorial you'll learn to implement a Liferay MVC portlet with all the
controller code in the `-Portlet` class.

## Configuring a WEB Module [](id=configuring-a-web-module)

As a naming convention, the module with your controller code and view layer is
referred to as the WEB module. A very basic WEB module might look
like this:

    docs.liferaymvc.web/
        src/main/java/
            com/liferay/docs/liferaymvc/web/portlet/LiferayMVCPortlet.java
        src/main/resources/
            content/
                Language.properties
            META/-INF/resources/
                init.jsp
                view.jsp
        build.gradle
        bnd.bnd

Of course you're not tied to the use of Gradle or BndTools to build your
project. However, you do need a JAR with the proper OSGi headers defined, which
is easily done if you provide a `bnd.bnd` file. To see Liferay MVC portlets
built with Maven, BndTools, and Gradle, you can check out the tutorial on
[Liferay Sample Modules](develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-sample-modules).

## Specifying OSGi Metadata [](id=specifying-osgi-metadata)

At a minimum, you should specify the bundle symbolic name and the bundle version
for the OSGi runtime. Providing a human readable bundle name is also
recommended.

    Bundle-Name: Example Liferay MVC Web
    Bundle-SymbolicName: com.liferay.docs.liferaymvc.web
    Bundle-Version: 1.0.0

If you don't specify a `Bundle-SymbolicName`, one will be generated from the
project's directory path, which is suitable for many cases. If you specify the
bundle symbolic name yourself, it's a nice convention to use the root package
name as the bundle symbolic name.

## Creating a Portlet Component [](id=creating-a-portlet-component)

Using the OSGi Declarative Services component model makes it easy to publish
service implementations to the OSGi runtime. In this case an implementation of
the `javax.portlet.Portlet` service must be published. Declare this using an
`@Component` annotation in the portlet class:

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        service = Portlet.class
    )
    public class LiferayMVCPortlet extends MVCPortlet {
    }

Since Liferay's `MVCPortlet` is itself an extension of `javax.portlet.Portlet`,
you've provided the right implementation. That's good in itself, but the
component needs to be fleshed out with some properties:

    @Component(
        immediate = true,
        property = {
            "com.liferay.portlet.display-category=category.sample",
            "com.liferay.portlet.instanceable=true",
            "javax.portlet.display-name=Liferay MVC Portlet",
            "javax.portlet.init-param.template-path=/",
            "javax.portlet.init-param.view-template=/view.jsp",
            "javax.portlet.resource-bundle=content.Language",
            "javax.portlet.security-role-ref=power-user,user"
        },
        service = Portlet.class
    )
    public class LiferayMVCPortlet extends MVCPortlet {
    }

Some of those properties might look familiar to you if you've developed Liferay
MVC portlets before Liferay 7. That's because they correspond with the XML
attributes you used to specify in `liferay-portlet.xml`, `liferay-display.xml`,
and `portlet.xml`. To find a list of all the Liferay-specific
attributes you can specify as properties in your portlet components, check out
the
[liferay-portlet-app_7_0_0.dtd](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/definitions/liferay-portlet-app_7_0_0.dtd.html). 
This is still maintained as a DTD to keep compatibility with the JSR-168 and
JSR-286 portlet specs. 

Consider the `<instanceable>` element from the above link as an example. To
specify that property in your component, use this syntax in your property list:

    "com.liferay.portlet.instanceable=true",

The properties namespaced with `javax.portlet....` are elements of the
[portlet.xml descriptor](http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/portlet/portlet-app_2_0.xsd).

Liferay's DTD files can be found
[here](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/definitions/).

You can publish this portlet component, but it doesn't do anything yet. You'll
implement the Controller code next.

## Writing Controller Code [](id=writing-controller-code)

In MVC, your controller receives requests from the front end, and it receives
data from the back end. It's responsible for sending that data to the right
front end view so it can be displayed to the user, and it's responsible for
taking data the user entered in the front end and passing it to the right back
end service. For this reason, it needs a way to process requests from the front
end and respond to them appropriately, and it needs a way to determine the
appropriate front end view to pass data back to the user. 

For data coming from the user to the back end, Liferay's MVC portlet framework
offers you two ways to do this. One of these is designed for smaller
applications, and the other is designed for larger applications. First, you'll
learn about processing requests in smaller applications. After that, you'll
learn about how data is rendered from the back end to the user. For processing
requests in larger applications, see the tutorials [MVC Action Command](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-action-command), 
[MVC Render Command](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-render-command), 
and [MVC Resource Command](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/mvc-resource-command). 
But read these after you finish this one, so you can understand how the whole
framework works. 

### Action Methods [](id=action-methods)

If you have a small application, you can implement all your controller code in
your portlet class (the same one you annotated with `@Component`), which acts as
your controller by itself. For processing requests, you use action methods.
Here's what an action method might look like:

    public void addGuestbook(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response)
            throws PortalException, SystemException {

        ServiceContext serviceContext = ServiceContextFactory.getInstance(
            Guestbook.class.getName(), request);

        String name = ParamUtil.getString(request, "name");

        try {
            _guestbookService.addGuestbook(serviceContext.getUserId(),
                    name, serviceContext);

            SessionMessages.add(request, "guestbookAdded");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            SessionErrors.add(request, e.getClass().getName());

            response.setRenderParameter("mvcPath",
                "/html/guestbook/edit_guestbook.jsp");
        }

    }

In this action method, the `ActionRequest` object is used to retrieve two pieces
of information that are needed to call the `addGuestbook` service, which is the
point of the method. If successful, the `SessionMessages` object is used to
store a success message. If an exception is thrown, it's caught, and the
appropriate `SessionErrors` object is used to store the exception message. Note
the call to the `setRenderParameter` method on the `ActionResponse`. This is
used to render the `edit_guestbook.jsp` if a guestbook could not be added, by
setting the `mvcPath` parameter. This parameter is a convention in Liferay's
`MVCPortlet` framework that denotes the next view that should be displayed to
the user. 

### Render Logic [](id=render-logic)

So what might a render method look like? First, note that implementing render
logic might not be necessary at all. Note the `init-param` properties you set in
your Component:

    "javax.portlet.init-param.template-path=/",
    "javax.portlet.init-param.view-template=/view.jsp",

With these, you're directing the default rendering to your `view.jsp`. The
`template-path` property tells the MVC framework where your JSP files live. In
the above example, `/` means that the JSP files are located in your project's
root `resources` folder. That's why it's important to follow Liferay's standard
folder structure, outlined above. Here's the path of a hypothetical Web
module's resource folder:

    docs.liferaymvc.web/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources

In this case, the `view.jsp` file is found at

    docs.liferaymvc.web/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/view.jsp

and that's the default view of the application. When the `init` method is
called, the initialization parameters you specify are read and used to direct
rendering to the default JSP. Throughout the controller, you can render a
different view (JSP file) by setting the render parameter `mvcPath`, like this:

    actionResponse.setRenderParameter("mvcPath", "/error.jsp");

In some cases, the uses of initialization parameters and render parameters
obviates the need for additional render logic. However, it's often necessary to
provide additional render logic. To do this, override the `render` method.
Here's an example:

    @Override
    public void render(RenderRequest renderRequest,
            RenderResponse renderResponse) throws PortletException, IOException {

        try {
            ServiceContext serviceContext = ServiceContextFactory.getInstance(
                    Guestbook.class.getName(), renderRequest);

            long groupId = serviceContext.getScopeGroupId();

            long guestbookId = ParamUtil.getLong(renderRequest, "guestbookId");

            List<Guestbook> guestbooks = _guestbookService
                    .getGuestbooks(groupId);

            if (guestbooks.size() == 0) {
                Guestbook guestbook = _guestbookService.addGuestbook(
                        serviceContext.getUserId(), "Main", serviceContext);

                guestbookId = guestbook.getGuestbookId();

            }

            if (!(guestbookId > 0)) {
                guestbookId = guestbooks.get(0).getGuestbookId();
            }

            renderRequest.setAttribute("guestbookId", guestbookId);

        } catch (Exception e) {

            throw new PortletException(e);
        }

        super.render(renderRequest, renderResponse);

    }

With render logic, you're providing the view layer with information to
display the data properly to the user. In this case, there's some information
needed at the outset, and then there's some logic in the `if` statements that
determine if there are any Guestbooks that can be displayed. If not, a Guestbook
should be created by default. If there are Guestbooks in the database, the ID
that's first in the list retrieved via the `getGuestbooks` method should be
displayed. This is accomplished by passing the appropriate ID to the
`RenderRequest` using the `setAttirbute` method. Since this logic should be
executed before the default `render` method, the method concludes by calling
`super.render`.

**Note:** Are you wondering how to call Service Builder services in Liferay 7.0?
Refer to [the tutorial on Finding and Invoking Liferay Services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/finding-and-invoking-liferay-services)
for a more detailed explanation. In short, obtain a reference to the service by
annotating a setter method with the `@Reference` Declarative Services
annotation and set the service object as a private variable.

    private GuestbookService _guestbookService;

    @Reference(unbind = "-")
    protected void setGuestbookService(GuestbookService guestbookService) {
        _guestbookService = guestbookService;
    }

Once done, you can call the service's methods.

    _guestbookService.addGuestbook(serviceContext.getUserId(), "Main",
            serviceContext);

### Setting and Retrieving Request Parameters and Attributes [](id=setting-and-retrieving-request-parameters-and-attributes)

In the portlet class's render method action methods, and even in your JSPs, you
can use a handy utility class called
[`ParamUtil`](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/7.0/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/util/ParamUtil.html)
to retrieve parameters from an `ActionRequest` or a `RenderRequest`.

    long guestbookId = ParamUtil.getLong(renderRequest, "guestbookId");

In the above example, the parameter was set into an action request in a JSP:

    <portlet:param name="guestbookId" 
            value="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getGuestbookId()) %>" />

You can also set attributes into the request using the method

    request.setAttribute();

in your portlet class. To read the attribute in a JSP, use the method

    request.getAttribute();

To set parameters into the response in your controller code, you can use the
`setRenderParameter` method.

    actionResponse.setRenderParameter("mvcPath", "/error.jsp");

Passing information back and forth from your view and controller is important,
but there's more to the view layer than that.

## Configuring the View Layer [](id=configuring-the-view-layer)

You now know how to extend Liferay's `MVCPortlet` to write controller code and
register a Component in the OSGi runtime. You also need a view layer, of course,
and for that, you'll use JSPs. Liferay's Lexicon Experience Language can be used
to guide your app's styling so it matches Liferay's. To learn about Lexicon and
about some of Liferay's taglibs, refer to the tutorial [Applying Lexicon Styles to Your App](develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app).
This section will briefly cover how to get your view layer working, from
organizing your imports in one JSP file, to configuring URLs that direct
processing to your code in the portlet class. 

It's a good practice to put all your Java imports, tag library declarations, and
variable initializations into an `init.jsp` file. If you use Liferay IDE to
create your Web module, these taglib declarations and initializations are
automatically added to your `init.jsp`:

    <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>

    <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0" prefix="portlet" %>

    <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/aui" prefix="aui" %>
    <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/portlet" prefix="liferay-portlet" %>
    <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/theme" prefix="liferay-theme" %>
    <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/ui" prefix="liferay-ui" %>

    <liferay-theme:defineObjects />

    <portlet:defineObjects />

Make sure you include the `init.jsp` in your other JSP files:

    <%@include file="/html/init.jsp"%>

You can, if necessary, write Java code in your JSPs using scriptlets. Perhaps you set
an attribute into the request in your controller:

    renderRequest.setAttribute("guestbookId", guestbookId);

You can reference it in your JSP by calling the `renderRequest.getAttribute`
method:

    <%
        long guestbookId = Long.valueOf((Long) renderRequest
                .getAttribute("guestbookId"));
    %>

To construct a URL that calls the `render` method of your controller, you can
use the `portlet:renderURL` tag:

    <portlet:renderURL var="searchURL">
			<portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/admin/view.jsp" />
    </portlet:renderURL>

You create a variable to hold the generated URL with the `var` attribute.
Then you can set any parameters you need using the `portlet:param` tag. The
`mvcPath` parameter is used to direct to another JSP. The example above points
to a JSP in

    docs.liferaymvc.web/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/admin/view.jsp

You can then use the `var` value to invoke the URL in your JSP code, perhaps
in a button or navigation bar item.

Action URLs can be similarly created with the `portlet` taglib:

    <portlet:actionURL name="doSomething" var="doSomethingURL">
        <portlet:param name="redirect" value="<%= redirect %>" />
    </portlet:actionURL>

The `name` of the action URL should match the action method name in your portlet
class; that's all Liferay's MVC framework needs in order to know that the action
method of the same name should run when this action URL is invoked. Use the
`var` attribute like you did the `var` attribute in the render URL; to call
the action URL in your JSP code, whether it's in an icon, a button, or somewhere
else.

As you can see, with Liferay MVC it's pretty easy to make your controller talk
to your view layer.
