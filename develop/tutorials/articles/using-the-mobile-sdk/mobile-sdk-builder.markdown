# Liferay Mobile SDK Builder [](id=liferay-mobile-sdk-builder)

The Liferay Mobile SDK is great for letting you connect your mobile apps to a 
Liferay instance. By accessing Liferay services through a Liferay Mobile SDK, 
your apps can access the data or functionality in a Liferay instance. But what 
happens when the services you need to use aren't built-in Liferay services? What 
if they're custom portlet services? No problem! In this case, you just need to 
build your own Mobile SDK to access the services of the custom portlets. 

The Mobile SDK Builder tutorials describe how to configure your portlet's remote
services, set up the Mobile SDK Builder, and then build a Liferay Android SDK
and a Liferay iOS SDK. Once you've built your SDKs, you'll be able to use them
just as you would the pre-built Liferay Android SDK and Liferay iOS SDK.
