# Creating JSPs for Displaying Custom Assets in the Asset Publisher [](id=creating-jsps-for-displaying-custom-assets-in-the-asset-publisher)

<div class="learn-path-step">
    <p>Adding Asset Features to Your UI<br>Step 2 of 5</p>
</div>

Before proceeding, you must tie up a loose end from the previous step. Remember 
that you implemented `getJspPath` methods in your `GuestbookAssetRenderer` and
`EntryAssetRenderer` classes to JSPs that don't exist yet. These methods return
paths to JSPs the Asset Publisher uses to display the assets' full content. The
`getJspPath` method of `GuestbookAssetRenderer` returns
`"/asset/guestbook/full_content.jsp"`, and the `getJspPath` method of
`EntryAssetRenderer` returns `"/asset/entry/full_content.jsp"`. It's time to
create these JSPs. 

Follow these steps: 

1.  In the `guestbook-web` module project, create a new folder called `asset` 
    under the `resources/META-INF/resources` folder. Add two folders to this new 
    folder: `entry` and `guestbook`. 

2.  Create a new file called `full_content.jsp` in the `/asset/guestbook` 
    folder. This JSP displays a guestbook asset's full content. Add the 
    following code to this file: 

        <%@include file="../../init.jsp"%>

        <%
        Guestbook guestbook = (Guestbook)request.getAttribute("gb_guestbook");

        guestbook = guestbook.toEscapedModel();
        %>

        <dl>
                <dt>Name</dt>
                <dd><%= guestbook.getName() %></dd>
        </dl>

    This JSP grabs the guestbook object from the request and displays the
    guestbook's name. In `GuestbookAssetRenderer`, the `getJspPath` method
    added the `gb_guestbook` request attribute: 

        request.setAttribute("gb_guestbook", _guestbook);

    The guestbook's `toEscapedModel` method belongs to the `GuestbookModelImpl`
    class, which was generated by Service Builder. This method returns a *safe*
    guestbook object (a guestbook in which each field is HTML-escaped). Calling 
    `guestbook = guestbook.toEscapedModel()` before displaying the guestbook 
    name ensures that your JSP won't display malicious code that's masquerading 
    as a guestbook name. 

3.  Next, in the `/asset/entry` folder, create a `full_content.jsp` for 
    displaying a guestbook entry asset's full content. Add the following code to 
    this file:

        <%@include file="../../init.jsp"%>

        <%
        Entry entry = (Entry)request.getAttribute("gb_entry");

        entry = entry.toEscapedModel();
        %>

        <dl>
                <dt>Guestbook</dt>
                <dd><%= GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbook(entry.getGuestbookId()).getName() %></dd>
                <dt>Name</dt>
                <dd><%= entry.getName() %></dd>
                <dt>Message</dt>
                <dd><%= entry.getMessage() %></dd>
        </dl>

This JSP shows a combination of fields from the Guestbook and the selected Entry. 

After deploying your changes, test your new JSPs by clicking a guestbook's or
guestbook entry's title in the Asset Publisher. The Asset Publisher renders
`full_content.jsp`: 

![Figure 1: When you click the title for a guestbook or guestbook entry in the Asset Publisher, your `full_content.jsp` should be displayed.](../../../../images/asset-publisher-full-content.png)

By default, when displaying an asset's full view, the Asset Publisher displays 
additional links for social media so you can publicize your asset. The *Back*
icon and the *View in Context* link return you to the Asset Publisher's default
view.
