# Extending the Audience Targeting application [](id=extending-the-audience-targeting-application)

Liferay's Audience Targeting application allows you to monitor your portal's
audience by dividing them into user segments, target specific content to those
user segments, and create campaigns to expose user segments to a certain set of
assets. Visit the
[Targeting Content to your Audience](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/targeting-content-to-your-audience)
chapter for more information on Audience Targeting and how to use it.

Although the Audience Targeting app can be configured to monitor your portal's
audience out of the box, it is also designed as a framework to be extended by
developers easily.

They have a set of extension points that can be easily hooked using other
plugins that can be hot deployed into your Liferay installation.

These extension points include:

* Rule Types
<!-- * Rules Engine -->
* Reports
* Tracking Actions

In this section's tutorials, you'll learn how to create these extension points
for your Audience Targeting application.
