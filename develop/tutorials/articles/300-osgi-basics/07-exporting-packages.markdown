# Exporting Packages [](id=exporting-packages)

OSGi module classes are inaccessible to other modules by default. To expose a
class, you must explicitly export its package. Exporting a package in your OSGi
bundle JAR's manifest makes all the package's classes available for other
bundles to
[import](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/importing-packages).

To export a package, you must add it to an `Export-Package` OSGi header. Here's
where to specify the `Export-Package` header in your project:

 Project Type | `Export-Package` header location |
 :----------- | :------------------------------- |
 Module (uses bnd)     | `[project]/bnd.bnd` |
 Module (doesn't use bnd) | `[module JAR]/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` |
 Traditional Liferay plugin WAR | `WEB-INF/liferay-plugin-package.properties` |

Module projects created using
[Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli),
[Liferay's Maven archetypes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/maven),
or
[Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-ide)
come with
[bnd](http://bnd.bndtools.org/).
When you build a module JAR, bnd propagates the OSGi headers from the project's
`bnd.bnd` file to the JAR's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.  

Here's a simple example of how to export packages from a `bnd.bnd` file:

    Export-Package:\
    com.liferay.petra.io,\
    com.liferay.petra.io.unsync

In module projects that don't use bnd, you must manually add package exports to
an `Export-Package` header in the module JAR's `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`. 

When you copy a traditional Liferay plugin WAR into the `[Liferay Home]/deploy`
folder, the
[WAB Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-wab-generator)
propagates the OSGi headers from the WAR's `liferay-plugin-package.properties`
file to the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file in the generated Web Application Bundle (WAB).

**Note**: bnd makes your module's exported packages *substitutable*. That is,
the OSGi framework can substitute your module's exported package with a
compatible package of the same name, but potentially different version, that's
exported from a different bundle. bnd achieves this substitutability for your
module by automatically making your module import every package it exports. In
this way, your module can work on its own, but can also work in conjunction
with bundles that provide a different (compatible) version, or even the same
version, of the package. A package from another bundle might provide better
"wiring" opportunities with other bundles.  For more details on substitutable
exports, see
[this blog post from Peter Kriens](http://blog.osgi.org/2007/04/importance-of-exporting-nd-importing.html).

Now you can share your module's terrific packages with other modules!
