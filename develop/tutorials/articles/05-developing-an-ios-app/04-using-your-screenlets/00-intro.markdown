# Using Your Screenlets [](id=using-your-screenlets)

Now that you have the Guestbook List and Entry List Screenlets, you're ready to 
put them to work. As you'll see, using these Screenlets isn't much more 
difficult than using Login Screenlet. This is an advantage of Screenlets; it 
typically takes only a few minutes to get them up and running. 

To add your Screenlets to the app, you'll follow these steps: 

1.  Create the entries scene.
2.  Add Guestbook List Screenlet to the guestbooks scene.
3.  Add Entry List Screenlet to the entries scene.

First, you'll create the entries scene.
