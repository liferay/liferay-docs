# Service Builder Web Services [](id=service-builder-web-services)

Service Builder can generate local and remote services for your 
Liferay apps. 
[The section of tutorials on Service Builder](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/what-is-service-builder) 
gives a general introduction to Service Builder, as well as instructions on
generating your app's local services. But Service Builder can also generate
remote web services automatically. Here, you'll learn how to both generate and
invoke remote JSON and SOAP web services. Because Liferay's web services are
created this way, knowing how to invoke these services opens many development
possibilities. This section includes the following tutorials:
