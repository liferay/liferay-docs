# Working with Collections of Data [](id=working-with-collections-of-data)

Collection resources are a common resource type that you'll encounter when 
working with @product@ web APIs. If you followed along with the previous 
examples, which send requests to the portal's organization resource URL, then 
you've already seen collections in action: the organization resource is a 
collection. Also, when you send a request to the portal's home URL, it returns 
URLs for four collection resources: `person`, `content-space`, `web-site`, and 
`organization`. Here, you'll learn more detailed information about working with 
collection resources.
