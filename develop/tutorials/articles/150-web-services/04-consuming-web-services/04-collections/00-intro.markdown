# Working with Collections of Data [](id=working-with-collections-of-data)

Collection resources are common in @product@ web APIs. If you followed along 
with the previous examples that sent requests to the portal's `organization` 
resource URL, you've already seen collections in action: the `organization`
resource is a collection. Also, when you send a request to the portal's home 
URL, it returns URLs for four collection resources: 

-   `person`
-   `content-space`
-   `web-site`
-   `organization` 

Here, you'll learn more detailed information about working with collection 
resources.
