# Consuming Web Services [](id=consuming-web-services)

Consuming web services is often the first thing that developers want to do when 
developing client apps. Since @product@'s web services are implemented via 
hypermedia REST APIs, developers can discover and traverse the APIs using the 
hypermedia URLs returned by the server in response to one or more requests.

**Note:** Hypermedia REST APIs are available starting with Liferay DXP 7.1 Fix 
Pack 1, and Liferay Portal CE 7.1 GA2. To consume web services in earlier 
releases, you must do so via 
[Service Builder Web Services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/service-builder-web-services), 
JAX-RS, or JAX-WS.
