# Consuming Web Services [](id=consuming-web-services)

Client apps can't work without web services to consume. Since @product@'s web
services are implemented via hypermedia REST APIs, developers can discover and
traverse the APIs using the hypermedia URLs that the server returns in response
to one or more requests.

must download and install the Hypermedia REST APIs app from Liferay Marketplace.

3+. For installation instructions, see the
