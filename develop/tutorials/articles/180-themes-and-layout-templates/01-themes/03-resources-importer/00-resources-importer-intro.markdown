# Importing Resources with a Theme [](id=importing-resources-with-a-theme)

To truly appreciate a theme, you must view it with content. Showcasing a theme 
in the proper context is key to communicating the true intentions of its design.
Who better to do this than the theme's designer? Designers can provide a sample
context that optimizes the design of their themes. The Resources Importer does
this for you.

The Resources Importer module lets theme developers import files and web content
with a theme. Administrators can use the site or site template created by the
Resources Importer to showcase the theme. In fact, all standalone themes that
are uploaded to Liferay Marketplace **must use** the Resources Importer. This
ensures a uniform experience for Marketplace users: a user can download a theme
from Marketplace, install it, go to Sites or Site Templates in the Control Panel
and immediately see their new theme in action.
