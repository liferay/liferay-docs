# Upgrading Your Theme from Liferay Portal 7.0 to 7.1 [](id=upgrading-7.0-themes-to-7.1)

This section of tutorials guides you through the process of upgrading your 7.0 
theme to run on @product-ver@. While you're at it, you should leverage theme 
improvements, including support for Bootstrap 4 and Lexicon 2.0. 

Theme upgrades involve these steps:

-  Updating project metadata
-  Updating CSS
-  Updating theme templates

No matter the environment in which you're developing your theme, these tutorials 
explain everything required to upgrade it. The easiest option is to use the 
gulp `upgrade` task. This, however, is only available for themes created with 
the 
[Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-themes). 
If you're upgrading in an environment other than the themes generator, follow 
the other tutorials in this section to upgrade your theme manually.
