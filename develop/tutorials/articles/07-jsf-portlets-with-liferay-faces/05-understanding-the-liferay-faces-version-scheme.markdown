# Understanding the Liferay Faces Version Scheme [](id=understanding-the-liferay-faces-version-scheme)

In this tutorial, you'll explore the Liferay Faces versioning scheme, and what
each component of a version means. [Liferay
Faces](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/overview)
follows a `Major1.Major2.Minor-Type` versioning scheme: 

`Major1`: 

- `1` = Portlet 1.0 Bridge for JSF 1.2 (JSR 301) *(Note that Liferay Faces
does not support Portlet 1.0)* 
- `2` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 1.2 (JSR 329) 
- `3` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 2.1 (JSR TBA) 
- `4` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 2.2 (JSR TBA) 

`Major2`: 

- `0-legacy` = Liferay `5.2` 
- `0` = Liferay `6.0` 
- `1` = Liferay `6.1` 
- `2` = Liferay `6.2` 

`Minor`: 

- May contain bug fixes, improvements, and new features. 

`Type`: 

- GA (General Availability) 
- RC (Release Candidate) 
- BETA (Beta Quality) 
- ALPHA (Alpha Quality) 

*Examples*: 

- `3.1.0-ga1`: First GA release for JSF 2.0/2.1 for use with Liferay 6.1.x 
- `3.1.1-ga2`: Second GA release for JSF 2.0/2.1 for use with Liferay 6.1.x

**Note:** Some permutations of this versioning scheme are not supported, see
table below for specific information on supported versions of JSF and Liferay
Portal.

The following table displays the Liferay Faces version and its compatible
Liferay Portal and JSF versions: 

| Liferay Faces Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | JSF Version (`Major1`)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Liferay Portal Version (`Major2`) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `2.1.x`               | `1.2`                  | `6.1`                             |
| `3.0.x-legacy`        | `2.1`                  | `5.2`                             |
| `3.0.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.0`                             |
| `3.1.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.1`                             | 
| `3.2.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.2`                             |
| `4.2.x` (master)      | `2.2`                  | `6.2`                             |

While Liferay Faces Bridge is theoretically compatible with any portal that
implements the Portlet 2.0 standard, it has been carefully tested for use with
Liferay Portal versions 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 and has several optimizations
that provide increased performance on Liferay. 

If you've developed portlets that use the
[PortletFaces](http://www.portletfaces.org/en) Bridge, you'll need to migrate
them to Liferay Faces in order to deploy them using the Liferay Faces
Bridge--don't worry, it's very straightforward. 

<!-- You can learn how to do this in the Liferay Faces Migrating tutorials
starting with the [Migrating BridgeRequestAttributeListener to Liferay Faces]()
tutorial. -->

With the knowledge of the Liferay Faces versioning scheme under your belt, you
can now recognize what each version supports.
