Assuring top quality is paramount in producing awesome software. Test driven
development plays a key role in this process. Liferay's tooling and integration
with standard test frameworks support test driven development and help you reach
quality milestones. Liferay lets you use whatever testing framework you want.
There's
[JUnit](https://junit.org)
for unit testing,
[Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/)
for integration testing, and more; consult the testing framework's
documentation for details. 

Here are the ways Liferay facilitates testing:

- [Injecting Service Components into Tests](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/injecting-service-components-into-tests):

    tests.
