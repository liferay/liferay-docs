# Creating a Theme Thumbnail [](id=creating-a-theme-thumbnail)

Have you associated a thumbnail image with your theme? In the *Look and Feel*
settings of your site pages in the Site Administration screen, notice that each
available theme has a thumbnail image. It's time to dress up your theme with
stylistic appeal by creating a thumbnail image for it. 

Here are the steps for setting up a thumbnail image for your theme:

1.  Create a thumbnail image. Make sure it's 150 pixels wide by 120 pixels high.
    You may want to take a snapshot of your theme and re-size it to these
    dimensions. It is very important to abide by these *exact* dimensions or
    your image won't display properly as a thumbnail. 

2.  Save the image as a `.png` file named `thumbnail.png` and place it in your
    theme's `docroot/_diffs/images` folder (create this folder if it
    doesn't already exist). On redeployment, your `thumbnail.png` file
    automatically displays as your theme's thumbnail.

Now, when you visit your the *Look and Feel* settings, your theme's thumbnail
displays along with the thumbnail images of other themes available to your site.

Congrats! Now you know how to create a thumbnail image for your theme!
