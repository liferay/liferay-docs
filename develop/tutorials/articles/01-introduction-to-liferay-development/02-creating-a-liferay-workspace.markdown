# Creating a Liferay Workspace

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your Liferay projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create Liferay 7.0 modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace.

Your workspace offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage the
generated directories. There are also some directories that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's directory structure any way you'd like.

For this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate a Liferay Workspace using Blade
tools. You can also create a Liferay Workspace using Liferay IDE, which runs on
Blade tools behind the scenes. You'll learn about using IDE's interface to do
this, if you prefer IDE's graphical interface over the command prompt. Before
attempting to create a Liferay Workspace via Blade tools in the command prompt,
make sure you've installed Blade, which is covered in the previous section
[Introduction to Blade Tools](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-blade-tools).

Buckle up! You're about to create your own Liferay 7.0 Workspace!

## Using Blade to Create Your Workspace

The Blade tool you installed in the previous section provides many different
commands to help build and customize Liferay projects. The first thing you
should do before building and customizing projects is create a Liferay
Workspace. Your workspace is the home for all your custom Liferay projects.
Navigate to the directory you'd like to create your workspace and run the
following command from your command prompt:

    blade init [WORKSPACE_NAME]

Once your workspace is generated, take a look at its directory structure. You
have several folders and build/properties files that were autogenerated. 

- `modules`: holds your custom modules which are built using the `blade create`
command. You'll learn more about building modules in the next
[section](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-liferay-applications).
- `themes`: holds your custom themes which are built using the Theme Generator.
- `configs`: holds the configuration files for different environments. These
files serve as your global configuration files for all Liferay servers and
projects residing in your workspace. Configuration files could span from your
Liferay instance's `portal-ext.properites` file, your database driver, etc.
Lastly, the `gradle` folder holds the Gradle Wrapper used by your workspace.
- `gradle`: holds the Gradle Wrapper used by your workspace.

The build/properties files included in your workspace's root directory sets your
workspace's Gradle properties and facilitates the build processes of your custom
plugins.

You'll learn about how to use these folders and properties files throughout the
next few tutorials. Before you begin using your workspace, it's a good practice
to set your workspace Gradle properties in the `gradle.properties` file. There
are several commented out properties in this file. These are the default
properties set in your workspace. If you'd like to change a variable, uncomment
the variable and set it to a custom value. For instance, if you want to store
your modules in a directory other than the `[ROOT]/modules` directory, uncomment
the `liferay.workspace.modules.dir` variable and set it to a different directory
value.

Next you'll learn about generating and using a Liferay instance from within your
workspace.

### Running a Liferay Instance from Your Workspace

Liferay Workspaces have the capability of generating and holding a Liferay
Server. This lets you build/test your plugins against a running Liferay
instance. Before generating a Liferay instance, open your `gradle.properties`
file located in the workspace's root folder. Notice you have several
configurable properties for your workspace's Liferay instance. For instance, you
can set the version of Liferay you'd like to generate and install (e.g.,
`7.0-ce-b2`).

Once you've finalized your Gradle properties, use your command prompt to
navigate to your workspace's root directory and run

    gradlew initBundle

As you read earlier, the workspace uses a Gradle wrapper to download and use
Gradle build tools. This command downloads the version of Liferay you specified
in your Gradle properties and installs your Liferay instance in the `bundles`
folder. To start your Liferay instance, run

    blade server start -b

This command starts your Tomcat server in a separate window. You also have the
option to run your server in debug mode (-d).

Awesome! You have a built-in Liferay server in your workspace and can start the
server using Blade tools. Next you'll learn how to use your legacy Plugins SDK
from your workspace.

### Using a Plugins SDK from Your Workspace

With Liferay 7.0 transitioning to a module-based framework, the current
structure of a Liferay Workspace is centered around module development. There
are, however, many developers in situations where they still must create
WAR-style plugins using the Plugins SDK. Because of this, your workspace is also
configured to work with your Plugins SDK. This means you can take advantage of
all the cool new Blade features and still use the Plugins SDK. To learn more
about how to convert legacy applicationss to 7.0 modules and what you should
consider before making the jump, visit the
[Converting Legacy Applications to Modules](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/converting-legacy-applications-to-modules)
tutorial.

If you revisit your workspace's `gradle.properties` file, you'll notice your
Plugins SDK directory is set to `plugins-sdk`. This folder was not generated by
default, so you'll have to create it yourself. In your workspace's root
directory, create the `plugins-sdk` folder. Then copy your legacy Plugins SDK
files into the `plugins-sdk` folder.

One last thing you must do to ensure your Plugins SDK works properly in the
context of your workspace is to generate all its requirements. These
requirements include the build JARs the Plugins SDK relies on to function
properly. To download the necessary requirements for your Plugins SDK, run the
following command from your workspace's root directory:

    gradlew tasks

Once the downloading is complete, your Plugins SDK is ready to use in your
workspace. It's as simple as that!

Next you'll learn about using Liferay Workspaces in Liferay IDE.

## Using Liferay IDE to Create Your Workspace

Using Blade Tools from the command prompt is certainly servicable, and caters to
those who enjoy using the command prompt to develop project. There are, however,
developers who prefer using an IDE for a nice GUI. If you're one of those
developers, Liferay provides the same workspace functionality through Liferay
IDE so you can continue using Liferay IDE as your one-stop shop for all your
Liferay developer needs. If you're curious about the directory structure and
configuration files in a Liferay Workspace, visit the
[Using Blade to Create Your Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#using-blade-to-create-your-workspace)
section.

To create a Liferay Workspace in IDE, select *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay
Workspace*.

![Figure 1: By selecting *Liferay Workspace*, you begin the process of creating a new workspace for your Liferay projects.](../../images/selecting-liferay-workspace.png)

A *New Liferay Workspace* popup window appears, presenting several configuration
options. Follow the instructions below to create your workspace.

1. Give your workspace a name. 

2. Choose the location that you'd like your workspace to reside. Checking the
   *Use default location* checkbox places your Liferay Workspace in the Eclipse
   workspace you're working in.

3. Check the *Download Liferay bundle* checkbox if you'd like to auto-generate a
   Liferay instance in your workspace. You'll be prompted to name the server, if
   selected. This Liferay bundle is generated the same way as described in the
   previous section.

4. Check the *Add project to working set* checkbox if you'd like the workspace
to be a part of a larger working set you've already created in IDE. For more
information on working sets, visit
[Eclipse Help](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcworkset.htm).

5. Click *Finish* to create your Liferay Workspace.

![Figure 2: Liferay IDE provides an easy-to-follow menu to create your Liferay Workspace.](../../images/new-workspace-menu.png)

You'll find your new workspace in the Project Explorer and your Liferay server
(if you created it) in the Servers menu. It's important to note that an Eclipse
workspace can only have one Liferay Workspace project.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a Liferay Workspace using the
command prompt and Liferay IDE. Now that your workspace is created, you can
begin creating Liferay plugins.
