# Themelets [](id=themelets)

Themelets are small, extendable, and reusable pieces of code. Whereas themes
require multiple components, a themelet only requires the files you wish to
extend. This creates a more modular approach to theme design, that lends itself
well to collaboration, and reduces the need for duplicated code in your theme.

Themelets allow developers to easily share code snippets across their themes and
with other developers. A themelet can consist of CSS, JavaScript, and templates,
just like a theme.

Themelets are very flexible, and therefore they have a number of possible uses.
You can make a themelet to modify the appearance of Liferay 7 admin tools, or a
themelet that uses a custom JavaScript component for responsive embedded videos.
For example, take a look at the [Liferay Product Menu Animation Themelet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lfr-product-menu-animation-themelet).
This themelet simply alters the animation for Liferay's Product Menu.

If there is something you find yourself coding over and over again for themes,
it's a good candidate for a themelet.

This tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Create a themelet to extend your theme

- Install a Themelet

In order to create a themelet, you need the Node.js build tools installed. The
[Themes Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/themes-generator)
tutorial explains how to install these tools and how to create a theme.

## Creating a Themelet [](id=creating-a-themelet)

Follow these steps to create a themelet:

1.  Open the Command Line and navigate to the directory you want to create your
    themelet in.

2.  Run `yo liferay-theme:themelet` and follow the prompts to generate the
    themelet.

    ![Figure 2: The Themelet sub-generator automates the themelet creation process, making it quick and easy.](../../images/themelet-prompt.png)
   
    The generated themelet contains a `package.json` file with configuraion
    information and a `src/css` directory that contains a `_custom.scss` file.
    Just like a theme, all of your updated files go into the `src` directory. In
    order to use your themelet in your theme, you must install it globally. This
    allows the themelet to be recognized by the generator. You'll take care of
    that next.

3.  Navigate into your newly created themelet directory and run 
    `npm link`. This creates a globally-installed symbolic link for the themelet
    in your npm packages directory.
			
    Note, you may need to run the command using `sudo npm link`. Now your
    themelet is available to install in your themes.
    
That's all you need to do to prepare your themelet to use in theme development.
Now you can develop your theme, making sure to add the files/directories to the
`src` directory of the themelet.

## Installing a Themelet [](id=installing-a-themelet)

After you've developed your themelet, follow the steps below to install it into
your theme.

1.  Navigate to your theme's root directory and run the following command:

        gulp extend

2.  Choose *Themelet* as the theme asset to extend.

3.  Select *Search globally installed npm modules*.

    ![Figure 3: You can extend your theme using globally installed npm modules or published npm modules.](../../images/install-themelet.png)

4.  Highlight your themelet, press spacebar to activate it, and press *Enter* to
    install it. 

5.  Run `gulp deploy` to build and deploy your theme with the new themelet
    updates.
   
Your themelet is installed! As you can see, themelets are a handy tool to add to
your theme development bag o' tricks.
