# Managing User Personal data

Enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) begins May 25,
2018. Companies processing the personal data of EU residents must adopt
appropriate measures to protect their user data. A wealth of available
resources discuss the implications of the regulation and the steps
companies must take to ensure compliance.

The goal of this article is to help you tackle two of GDPR's technically
challenging requirements, the 
[right to data portability](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/) 
and the 
[right to be forgotten](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) 
on Liferay Portal 6.2. For the upcoming release of @product@ 7.1, this 
[blog post](https://web.liferay.com/web/dennis.ju/blog/-/blogs/upcoming-gdpr-focused-features-for-liferay-d-1)
describes new features to more easily tackle these requirements. These same
features will be available for @product@ version 7.0 in a future service pack
release following the release of @product@ version 7.1. Until then, the
principles and code described here equally apply to versions 6.2 and 7.0.
Version 7.1 will have better native support for complying with GDPR. Consider
upgrading to leverage those features (and more, of course).

The code supplied here demonstrates an approach you can use when developing two
particularly difficult requirements of your full GDPR solution. It's ultimately your
responsibility to assess your own organization's usage of personal data and the work required to fully comply with
GDPR. 

The code referenced here could be deployed via the scripting console, or
compiled in a web plugin. It's up to you. A sample web plugin containing this
code can be referenced
[here](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/6.2.x/webs/sample-personal-data-web).

## Right to Data Portability

The 
[right to data portability](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/) 
requires organizations to provide a machine-readable export of a user's personal
data upon request.

There's no easy way through the UI to export a given user's personal data on
Liferay Portal 6.2. One straightforward way to programmatically fulfill this
requirement for applications built using Service Builder is to leverage
[Actionable Dynamic Queries](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/dynamic-query).

In this example, we'll export all of a user's blogs created using Liferay's
[Blogs](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-blogs)
app to a JSON-formatted file. We start by creating an instance of
`BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery` and overriding the `addCriteria` method to
grab all `BlogEntries` that match the user by `userId` or `statusByUserId`. This
should return all blogs where the user is the original author or the last
editor.

    ActionableDynamicQuery actionableDynamicQuery = new BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery() {

        @Override
        protected void addCriteria(DynamicQuery dynamicQuery) {
            Criterion criterion = RestrictionsFactoryUtil.or(
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("userId", userId),
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("statusByUserId", userId));

                dynamicQuery.add(criterion);
        }

        @Override
        protected void performAction(Object object) throws PortalException, SystemException {
            // do something
        }
    };

Next we override `performAction` to write all matching `BlogEntries` to a JSON
array. We'll use the 
[FasterXML Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
library to JSONify our output as it provides powerful customization features.

    // the path of our export file
    Path path = Files.createTempFile("export_blogsEntries", ".json");

    JsonFactory jsonFactory = new JsonFactory();

    final JsonGenerator jsonGenerator = jsonFactory.createGenerator(path.toFile(), JsonEncoding.UTF8);

    // begin the JSON array
    jsonGenerator.writeStartObject();
    jsonGenerator.writeFieldName(BlogsEntry.class.getName());
    jsonGenerator.writeStartArray();

    final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    // avoid exception when Jackson can't serialize a bean
    objectMapper.configure(SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS, false);

    ActionableDynamicQuery actionableDynamicQuery = new BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery() {
        @Override
        protected void addCriteria(DynamicQuery dynamicQuery) {
            Criterion criterion = RestrictionsFactoryUtil.or(
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("userId", userId),
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("statusByUserId", userId));

            dynamicQuery.add(criterion);
        }

        @Override
        protected void performAction(Object object) throws PortalException, SystemException {
            try {
                objectMapper.writeValue(jsonGenerator, object);
            }
            catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    };

    actionableDynamicQuery.performActions();

    // end the JSON array
    jsonGenerator.writeEndArray();
    jsonGenerator.writeEndObject();
    jsonGenerator.close();

This naive implementation serializes all fields for `BlogsEntries` including
system data like groupId, allowPingbacks, status, etc. The output will look
something like:

    {
        "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model.BlogsEntry": [
            {
                "visible": true,
                "inTrashExplicitly": false,
                "smallImageType": null,
                "content": "<p>Hello everyone! ...</p>",
                "cachedModel": false,
                "description": "",
                "new": false,
                ...
            }    
        ]
    }

Since we only need to export a user's personal data, we can leverage Jackson's
filters to specify which fields to export.

    // specify the field names we want to export
    Set<String> exportFields = new HashSet<String>(
        Arrays.asList("entryId", "title", "subtitle", "description", "content"));

    filterProvider.addFilter(
        "blogsEntriesFilter", new SimpleBeanPropertyFilter.FilterExceptFilter(exportFields));

    JacksonAnnotationIntrospector jacksonAnnotationIntrospector =
        new JacksonAnnotationIntrospector() {

        @Override
        public Object findFilterId(Annotated annotated) {
            return "blogsEntriesFilter";
        }
    };

    objectMapper.setAnnotationIntrospector(jacksonAnnotationIntrospector);

    final ObjectWriter objectWriter = objectMapper.writer(filterProvider);

    ActionableDynamicQuery actionableDynamicQuery = new BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery() {
        ...

        @Override
        protected void performAction(Object object) throws PortalException, SystemException {
            try {
                objectWriter.writeValue(jsonGenerator, object);
            }
            catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    };

Now the exported data is cleaner and only contains user-inputted personal data.

    {
        "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model.BlogsEntry": [
            {
                "content": "<p>Hello everyone! ...</p>",
                "description": "",
                "title": "Introducing Dennis",
                "entryId": 11217
            }
        ]
    }

As this code is essentially boilerplate for all of Liferay's service generated
classes, it's possible to generalize this solution using reflection. 

## Right to be Forgotten

The 
[right to erasure](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/) 
(also known as the "right to be forgotten") requires organizations to erase a
user's personal data upon request (excluding data the
organization has a legitimate reason to retain like financial records, public
interest data, etc).

### Erasing the data

Unfortunately, simply deleting the `User` object by calling
`UserLocalServiceUtil.deleteUser(User user)` does not sufficiently fulfill this
requirement as content created by the user is understandably not deleted.
Fortunately, we can leverage the same logic in the Data Portability code example
to locate and delete a user's personal data. Continuing with our `BlogsEntries`
example, we can simply delete any blog where the `userId` or `statusByUserId`
matches.

    ActionableDynamicQuery actionableDynamicQuery = new BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery() {
        @Override
        protected void addCriteria(DynamicQuery dynamicQuery) {
            Criterion criterion = RestrictionsFactoryUtil.or(
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("userId", userId),
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("statusByUserId", userId));

            dynamicQuery.add(criterion);
        }

        @Override
        protected void performAction(Object object) throws PortalException, SystemException {
            BlogsEntry blogsEntry = (BlogsEntry)object;
            
            BlogsEntryLocalServiceUtil.deleteEntry(blogsEntry);
        }
    };

    actionableDynamicQuery.performActions();

### Anonymizing the data

But what if our blogs contain valuable data we want to keep? Perhaps a community
member wrote a blog post on DE 7.0 upgrade tips but now requests to be
forgotten. In many cases, businesses will want to anonymize personal data
instead of deleting it. Anonymization requires data to be scrubbed such that it
"does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person" or in "such a
manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable" 
([recital 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)).

This means at the very least we should alter the `userName` field so the user no
longer appears as the author or editor of the blog. But proper anonymization
requires more than just replacing names, email addresses, and other personally
identifiable data. The content of the blog itself must be reviewed and
sanitized. For example, a blog post on DE 7.0 upgrade tips might begin with an
anecdotal introduction like, "I've seen some horror stories in my ten years as
the IT director of Gamora Inc ..." Even though this sentence doesn't include any
contact details, it's easy to identify the author via a quick social media
search. Unfortunately, this means proper anonymization can potentially be an
extremely cumbersome process. Imagine reviewing the thousands of forum posts an
active member may have posted. Ultimately, whether and to what extent a business
must judiciously review and edit every word, image, and detail during
anonymization needs to be evaluated by each business. The scale, sensitivity,
likelihood of identification and so on must be weighed, reasoned, and
documented.

For our example, let's say we want to review the data first. One approach is to
first export the personal data using the code from the "data portability"
section and review the blog title, subtitle, content, etc. Various strategies
can be used to search for certain contact details (like user alias, email
addresses, phone numbers, etc). The content can then be updated either
programmatically or through Liferay's web interface.

After the content has been satisfactorily sanitized, we can replace the `userId`
and `userName` using the same `ActionableDynamicQuery` logic above. Before doing
so, we'd recommend creating an actual `User` object populated with anonymous
details. This will make it easier to identify all data in the future that's been
anonymized.

    // assume this user has already been created
    final User anonymousUser = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUser(anonymousUserId);

    final String anonymousUserName = anonymousUser.getFullName();

    ActionableDynamicQuery actionableDynamicQuery = new BlogsEntryActionableDynamicQuery() {
        @Override
        protected void addCriteria(DynamicQuery dynamicQuery) {
            Criterion criterion = RestrictionsFactoryUtil.or(
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("userId", userId),
                RestrictionsFactoryUtil.eq("statusByUserId", userId));

            dynamicQuery.add(criterion);
        }

        @Override
        protected void performAction(Object object) throws PortalException, SystemException {
            BlogsEntry blogsEntry = (BlogsEntry)object;

            if (blogsEntry.getUserId() == userId) {
                blogsEntry.setUserId(anonymousUserId);
                blogsEntry.setUserName(anonymousUserName);
            }
            
            if (blogsEntry.getStatusByUserId() == userId) {
                blogsEntry.setStatusByUserId(anonymousUserId);
                blogsEntry.setStatusByUserName(anonymousUserName);
            }

            BlogsEntryLocalServiceUtil.updateBlogsEntry(blogsEntry);
        }
    };

    actionableDynamicQuery.performActions();

Again, this solution is mostly boilerplate code and can be generalized to data
built using Liferay's Service Builder.

# Conclusion

These examples demonstrate how to leverage Liferay's existing API's to address
GDPR's new standard for personal data protection. Ultimately, true compliance
involves much more than technical measures; it requires re-thinking,
re-evaluating, and raising the standards of data protection for most modern
organizations.
