# Tooling

Liferay is very flexible when it comes to supporting different development
tooling. Instead of being pigeonholed into using a specific tool, Liferay allows
you to choose whatever tool you feel most comfortable with, and use it to
develop for your Liferay instance. In this set of tutorials, some of the more
popular tools that integrate with Liferay are discussed. If you're a Liferay
newbie looking for the best development tool for Liferay, or even a seasoned
veteran looking for a tool you may like more than your current setup, this
section will introduce you to popular tools and their respective installation,
syntax, and usability.
