# Registering JSON Web Services [](id=registering-json-web-services)

Liferay's developers use a tool called *Service Builder* to build services.
When you build services with Service Builder, all remote-enabled services
(i.e., `service.xml` entities with the property `remote-service="true"`) are
exposed as JSON web services. When each `*Service.java` interface is created
for a remote-enabled service, the `@JSONWebService` annotation is added to that
interface at the class level. All of the public methods of that interface
become registered and available as JSON web services.

The `*Service.java` interface source file should never be modified by the user.
If you need more control over its methods (e.g., if you need to hide some
methods while exposing others), you can configure the `*ServiceImpl` class. When
the service implementation class (`*ServiceImpl`) is annotated with the
`@JSONWebService` annotation, the service interface is ignored and the service
implementation class is used for configuration in its place. In other words,
`@JSONWebService` annotations in the service implementation override any JSON
web service configuration in the service interface.

That's it! Liferay scans all OSGi bundles registered with the `@Component` 
annotation or in a `*BundleActivator` class for remote services. Each class that 
uses the `@JSONWebService` annotation is examined and its methods become exposed 
via the JSON web services API. As explained previously, the `*ServiceImpl` 
configuration overrides the `*Service` interface configuration during 
registration.

**Note:** Liferay's developers use *Service Builder* to expose their services
via JSON automatically. If you haven't used Service Builder before, please see
the
[Service Builder section of tutorials](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/what-is-service-builder).
<!-- Service builder tutorials are in https://github.com/sez11a/liferay-docs/pull/1578 -->

Next, you'll see how you can register your application's remote services as JSON 
web services. Keep in mind that Liferay uses this same mechanism. This is why 
Liferay's remote services are exposed as JSON web services out-of-the-box. 

## Registering an App's JSON Web Services [](id=registering-an-apps-json-web-services)

As an example, say you have an app named `SupraSurf` that has some services, and 
you decide to expose them as remote services. After enabling the 
`remote-service` attribute on its `SurfBoard` entity, you rebuild the services. 
Service Builder regenerates the `SurfBoardService` interface, adding the
`@JSONWebService` annotation to it. This annotation tells Liferay that the 
interface's public methods are to be exposed as JSON web services, making them
a part of the app's JSON API. Start up your Liferay instance if it isn't 
running, and then deploy your app to Liferay. 

To get some feedback from your Liferay instance on registering your 
application's services, configure the instance to log the application's 
informational messages (i.e., its `INFO ...` messages). See the tutorials on 
Liferay's logging system for details. 
<!-- Link to logging system tutorials once they exist -->

To test Liferay's JSON web service registration process, add a simple method to
your app's services. Edit your `*ServiceImpl` class and add the following
method:

    public String helloWorld(String worldName) {
        return "Hello world: " + worldName;
    }

Rebuild the services and re-deploy your app's modules. You can now invoke this 
service method via JSON. For instructions on doing this, see the JSON invocation 
tutorials listed in 
[this section of tutorials](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/service-builder-web-services). 

This same mechanism registers Liferay's own services. They're conveniently 
enabled by default, so you don't have to configure them. 

Next, you'll learn how to form a mapped URL for the remote service so you can 
access it. 

## Mapping and Naming Conventions [](id=mapping-and-naming-conventions)
{{

This topic needs some clean up. There are 2 pairs of confusing names used here:

- `json.web.service.context.path`: is this `context-path` or `context-name`?
- `json.web.service.context.name`: is this `context-name` or `context-path`?
- `context-name`: used in the URL syntax
- `context-path`: used in its own bullet
- `app-context-name`: another odd name used in the `service-class-name` bullet

Also, please replace the `journal` example with the `suprasurf` example. Having
two examples showing different things only causes more confusions. 

}}

You can form the mapped URL of an exposed service by following the naming
convention below:

    http://[server]:[port]/api/jsonws/[context-path].[service-class-name]/[service-method-name]

Look at the last three bracketed items more closely: 

- `context-name` is the app's context name (e.g., `suprasurf` in the previous 
  example). Its value is specified via the `json.web.service.context.path` 
  property in the `@OSGiBeanProperties` annotation. For example, for Liferay web 
  content articles, Liferay's `JournalArticleService` class includes the 
  following annotation (among others): 

        @OSGiBeanProperties(property =  {
            "json.web.service.context.name=journal", "json.web.service.context.path=JournalArticle"}, service = JournalArticleService.class)

- `service-class-name` is generated from the service's class name in lower case,
  minus its `Service` or `ServiceImpl` suffix. For example, specify `surfboard`
  as the `app-context-name` for the `SurfBoardService` class. 
- `service-method-name` is generated from the service's method name by
  converting its camel case to lower case and using dashes (`-`) to separate
  words. 

The following example demonstrates these naming conventions by mapping a service 
method's URL using the naming conventions both on a custom service and on a 
Liferay service.

For the custom service method, the URL looks like:

    http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/suprasurf.surfboard/hello-world

Note the context name part of the URL. For Liferay, it's similar. Here's a 
Liferay service method:

    @JSONWebService
    public interface UserService {
        public com.liferay.portal.model.User getUserById(long userId) {...}

Here's that Liferay service method's URL:

    http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/user/get-user-by-id

Each service method is bound to one HTTP method type. Any method with a name
starting with `get`, `is`, or `has` is assumed to be a read-only method and is
mapped as a *GET HTTP* method by default. All other methods are mapped as *POST
HTTP* methods. 

Recall that you can see a list of your Liferay instance's JSON web services at 
[http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws](http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws). 
When you select a method on this page, the part of its HTTP method URL that 
follows `http://[server]:[port]/api/jsonws` is listed at the top of the screen. 

Conveniently, remote service requests can leverage the authentication 
credentials associated with the user's current Liferay session. Next, you'll 
learn how to prevent a method from being exposed as a service. 

## Ignoring a Method [](id=ignoring-a-method)

To keep a method from being exposed as a service, annotate the method with the
following option:

    @JSONWebService(mode = JSONWebServiceMode.IGNORE)

Methods with this annotation don't become part of the JSON Web Service API. 
Next, you'll learn how to define custom HTTP method and URL names. 

## HTTP Method and URL Names [](id=http-method-and-url-names)

At the method level, you can define custom HTTP method names and URL names. Just
use an annotation like this one:

    @JSONWebService(value = "add-board-wow", method = "PUT")
    public boolean addBoard(

In this example, the application's service method `addBoard` is mapped to URL
method name `add-board-wow`. Its complete URL is now
`http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws/suprasurf.surfboard/add-board-wow`
and can be accessed using the HTTP PUT method.

If the URL method name in a JSON web service annotation starts with a slash
character (`/`), only the method name is used to form the service URL; the class
name is ignored:

    @JSONWebService("/add-something-very-specific")
    public boolean addBoard(

Similarly, you can change the class name part of the URL, by setting the value
in a class-level annotation:

    @JSONWebService("sbs")
    public class SurfBoardServiceImpl extends SurfBoardServiceBaseImpl {

This maps all of the service's methods to a URL class name `sbs` instead
of the default class name `surfboard`.

Next, you'll learn a different approach to exposing your methods via manual 
registration.

## Manual Registration Mode [](id=manual-registration-mode)

Up to now, it's assumed that you want to expose most of your service methods,
while hiding some specific methods (the *blacklist* approach). Sometimes, 
however, you want the opposite: to explicitly specify only the methods you want 
to expose (the *whitelist* approach). This is possible by specifying *manual 
mode* on the class-level annotation. Then it's up to you to annotate only those 
methods you want to expose. For example:

    @JSONWebService(mode = JSONWebServiceMode.MANUAL)
    public class SurfBoardServiceImpl extends SurfBoardServiceBaseImpl{
        ...
        @JSONWebService
        public boolean addBoard(

Now only the `addBoard` method and any other method annotated with 
`@JSONWebService` are part of the JSON Web Service API; all of this service's 
other methods are excluded from the API.
