# Developing Your First Portlet [](id=developing-your-first-portlet)

So far, you've installed and set up @ide@, and created a Liferay Workspace. 
Next, you'll create your application and start adding basic features to it. 
Here's what you'll do: 

-   Create your application and deploy it to your @product@ instance. 
-   Create a functional button for adding and removing guestbook entries. 
-   Create a form for users to create and edit guestbook entries. 
-   Create a UI for displaying guestbook entries. 
-   Implement a prototype storage system (to be replaced later) for storing 
    guestbook entries. 

At the end, you'll have a fully functional prototype application ready to be
enhanced later! There's no time like now to get started.
