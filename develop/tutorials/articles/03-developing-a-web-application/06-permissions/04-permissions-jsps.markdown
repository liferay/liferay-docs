<div class="learn-path-step">
    <p>Implementing Permissions<br>Step 4 of 4</p>
</div>

User interface components can be wrapped in permission checks pretty easily. In
this step, you'll learn how. 

First go to the `init.jsp` in your `guestbook-web` project. Add the following 
imports to the file:

    <%@ page import="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.service.permission.GuestbookModelPermission" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.service.permission.GuestbookPermission" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.service.permission.EntryPermission" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.WebKeys" %>
    <%@ page import="com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.permission.ActionKeys" %>

The first three are the permissions helper classes you just created. Now it's 
time to implement permission checks. 

## Checking Permissions in the UI [](id=checking-permissions-in-the-ui)

Recall that you want to restrict access to three areas in your application: 

- The guestbook tabs across the top of your application
- The Add Guestbook button
- The Add Entry button

First, you'll create the guestbook tabs and check permissions for them. Follow 
these steps to do so: 

1.  Open `/guestbookwebportlet/view.jsp` and find the scriptlet that gets the 
    `guestbookId` from the request. Just below this, add the following code: 

        <aui:nav cssClass="nav-tabs">

            <%
                List<Guestbook> guestbooks = GuestbookLocalServiceUtil.getGuestbooks(scopeGroupId);

                    for (int i = 0; i < guestbooks.size(); i++) {

                        Guestbook curGuestbook = (Guestbook) guestbooks.get(i);
                        String cssClass = StringPool.BLANK;

                        if (curGuestbook.getGuestbookId() == guestbookId) {
                            cssClass = "active";
                        }

                        if (GuestbookPermission.contains(
                            permissionChecker, curGuestbook.getGuestbookId(), "VIEW")) {
                                                
            %>

            <portlet:renderURL var="viewPageURL">
                <portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/guestbookwebportlet/view.jsp" />
                <portlet:param name="guestbookId"
                    value="<%=String.valueOf(curGuestbook.getGuestbookId())%>" />
            </portlet:renderURL>

                
            <aui:nav-item cssClass="<%=cssClass%>" href="<%=viewPageURL%>"
                label="<%=HtmlUtil.escape(curGuestbook.getName())%>" />

            <%  
                        }
                    
                    }
            %>

        </aui:nav>

    This code gets a list of guestbooks from the database, iterates through 
    them, checks the permission for each against the current user's roles, and 
    adds the guestbooks the user can access to a list of tabs. 

    You've now implemented your first permission check. As you can see, it's 
    relatively straightforward thanks to the static methods in your helper 
    classes. The code above shows the tab only if the current user has the 
    `VIEW` permission for the guestbook. 

    Next, you'll add permission checks to the Add Entry button. 

2.  Scroll down to the line that reads 
    `<aui:button-row cssClass="guestbook-buttons">`. Just below this line, add 
    the following line of code to check for the `ADD_ENTRY` permission: 

        <c:if test='<%= GuestbookPermission.contains(permissionChecker, guestbookId, "ADD_ENTRY") %>'>

3.  After this is the code that creates the `addEntryURL` and the Add Entry 
    button. After the `aui:button` tag and above the `</aui:button-row>` tag, 
    add the closing tag for the `<c:if>` statement: 

        </c:if>

    You've now implemented your permission check for the Add Entry button by 
    using JSTL tags. 

Next, you'll implement an `entry_actions.jsp` that's much like the one in the 
Guestbook Admin portlet. This will determine what options appear for logged in
users who can see the actions menu in the portlet. Just like before, you'll wrap
each `renderURL` in a `if` statement that checks the permissions against 
available actions. To do this, follow these steps: 

1.  In `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/guestbookwebportlet`, create a 
    file called `entry_actions.jsp`. 

2.  In this file, add the following code: 

        <%@include file="../init.jsp"%>

        <%
        String mvcPath = ParamUtil.getString(request, "mvcPath");

        ResultRow row = (ResultRow)request.getAttribute(WebKeys.SEARCH_CONTAINER_RESULT_ROW);

        Entry entry = (Entry)row.getObject(); 
        %>

        <liferay-ui:icon-menu>

            <portlet:renderURL var="viewEntryURL">
                <portlet:param name="entryId" value="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getEntryId()) %>" />
                <portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/guestbookwebportlet/view_entry.jsp" />
            </portlet:renderURL>

            <liferay-ui:icon
                message="View"
                url="<%= viewEntryURL.toString() %>"
            />

            <c:if
                test="<%= EntryPermission.contains(permissionChecker, entry.getEntryId(), ActionKeys.UPDATE) %>">
                <portlet:renderURL var="editURL">
                    <portlet:param name="entryId"
                        value="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getEntryId()) %>" />
                    <portlet:param name="mvcPath" value="/guestbookwebportlet/edit_entry.jsp" />
                </portlet:renderURL>

                <liferay-ui:icon image="edit" message="Edit"
                    url="<%=editURL.toString() %>" />
            </c:if>

            <c:if
            test="<%=EntryPermission.contains(permissionChecker, entry.getEntryId(), ActionKeys.PERMISSIONS) %>">

                <liferay-security:permissionsURL
                    modelResource="<%= Entry.class.getName() %>"
                    modelResourceDescription="<%= entry.getMessage() %>"
                    resourcePrimKey="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getEntryId()) %>"
                    var="permissionsURL" />
            
                <liferay-ui:icon image="permissions" url="<%= permissionsURL %>" />

            </c:if>

            <c:if
                test="<%=EntryPermission.contains(permissionChecker, entry.getEntryId(), ActionKeys.DELETE) %>">

                <portlet:actionURL name="deleteEntry" var="deleteURL">
                    <portlet:param name="entryId"
                        value="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getEntryId()) %>" />
                    <portlet:param name="guestbookId"
                        value="<%= String.valueOf(entry.getGuestbookId()) %>" />
                </portlet:actionURL>

                <liferay-ui:icon-delete url="<%=deleteURL.toString() %>" />
            </c:if>

        </liferay-ui:icon-menu>

    This code defines several action buttons for viewing, updating, setting 
    permissions on, and deleting entities. Each button is protected by a 
    permissions check. If the current user can't perform the given action, the 
    action doesn't appear. 

5.  Finally, in `view.jsp`, you must add the `entry_actions.jsp` as the last
    column in the Search Container. Find the line defining the Search Container
    row. It looks like this: 

        <liferay-ui:search-container-row
            className="com.liferay.docs.guestbook.model.Entry" modelVar="entry">

    Below that line are two columns. After the second column, add a third: 

        <liferay-ui:search-container-column-jsp path="/guestbookwebportlet/entry_actions.jsp" align="right" />

6.  Save all JSP files. 

Excellent! You've now implemented all the permissions checks for the Guestbook 
portlet. 

When testing the application, remember that any guestbook entries you created
without resources won't work with permissions. Add new guestbooks and entries to 
test your application with different users. Administrative users see all the 
buttons, regular users see the Add Entry button, and guests see no buttons at 
all (but can navigate).

**Note:** You may see an error where the Guestbook portlet doesn't appear at 
all, and you see this error in the log: 

    Someone may be trying to circumvent the permission checker. 

This is because any data you currently have in the Guestbook application doesn't 
have resources. In this case, you must drop and re-create your database. To do
this, find your Liferay Workspace on your file system (it should be inside your
Eclipse workspace). Inside the `bundles/data` folder is a `hypersonic` folder.
Shut down @product@, remove everything from this folder, and then restart. After
adding guestbook to a page, the portlet will work normally. 

Alternatively you can connect to the database (hypersonic) using any support DB client
and delete the entried from table. You need to stop Liferay before in order to
delete the old entries

Now see if you can do the same for the Guestbook Admin portlet. Don't worry if
you can't: at the end of this Learning Path is a link to the completed project
for you to examine. 

Great! You're all done with permissions. The next step is to integrate search 
and indexing into your application. This is a prerequisite for the much more 
powerful stuff to come.
