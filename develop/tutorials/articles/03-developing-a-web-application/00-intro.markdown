# Developing a Web Application

In this Learning Path, you'll go through the steps to create the Guestbook 
Liferay Web Application from scratch using tools like @ide@ and BLADE tools. As 
you create the Guestbook, you'll learn how to create a back-end database, web 
services, a security model, UI, and more using all the best practices and 
standards for @product@. Completing this Learning Path will prepare you to 
write your own application and further explore Liferay's APIs. 

To develop a web application with Liferay, start at the beginning: setting 
up a Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text 
editor and the command line to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay provides @ide@ 
to optimize writing code on Liferay's platform. It integrates Liferay's 
BLADE tools for modular development. 

Once your development environment is set up, you'll jump right in to creating
the application. From modeling data to Service Builder, you'll learn everything
you need to know to create and run your base application. 

From there you'll see everything from UI standards to providing remote 
services. Once everything is completed and wrapped up with a bow, you can 
distribute the application on Marketplace.
