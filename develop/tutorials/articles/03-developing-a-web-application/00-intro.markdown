# Developing a Web Application [](id=developing-a-web-application)

In this Learning Path, you'll create the Liferay Guestbook Web Application from 
scratch using tools like Liferay @ide@ and BLADE tools. As you create this 
application, you'll learn how to create a back-end database, web services, a 
security model, UI, and more using all the best practices and standards for 
@product@. Completing this Learning Path will prepare you to write your own 
application and further explore Liferay's APIs. 

To develop a web application with Liferay, start at the beginning: setting up a 
Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text editor 
and the command line, to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay provides Liferay @ide@ 
to optimize development on Liferay's platform. It integrates Liferay's BLADE 
tools for modular development. 

Once your development environment is set up, you'll begin creating the 
application. From modeling data to Service Builder, you'll learn everything
you need to know to create and run your application. 

From there you'll see everything from UI standards to providing remote 
services. Once everything is completed and wrapped up with a bow, you can 
distribute the application on Marketplace.
