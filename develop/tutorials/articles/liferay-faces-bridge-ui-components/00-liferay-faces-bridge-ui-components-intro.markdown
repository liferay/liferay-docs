# Liferay Faces Bridge UI Components [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-ui-components)

Although the JSR 329 standard does not define any JSF components that bridge
implementations are required to provide, Liferay Faces Bridge comes with a
handful of components that are helpful to use in JSF portlets. 

Because Liferay Faces has several [active versions](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
(targeting different versions of JSF, Liferay Portal, etc.), there are several
versions of the project View Declaration Language (VDL) documentation for these
tags: 

**Liferay Faces 2.1:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>

**Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>

**Liferay Faces 3.0:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>

**Liferay Faces 3.1:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/> 

**Liferay Faces 3.2:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/> 

<!-- Re-add VDLs for 4.2 when released. - Jim
**Liferay Faces 4.2:** <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>
-->

Liferay Faces Bridge provides UI component tags under the `bridge` and `portlet`
namespaces for the Bridge and Portlet 2.0 tags, respectively. In the following
tutorials, you'll explore several of these tags and learn about how they work
inside a JSF portlet.
