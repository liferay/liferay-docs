# Introduction [](id=introduction-0)

Liferay 7.0 brings with it quite a few updates to the front-end development 
tools. You can now organize and share your code in a more logical way using 
the new JavaScript standard module syntax, thanks to our
[AMD Module Config Generator](https://github.com/ipeychev/lfr-module-config-generator) 
and [AMD Module Loader](https://github.com/ipeychev/lfr-amd-loader). You'll also be 
able to use any AMD compliant third party libraries.
