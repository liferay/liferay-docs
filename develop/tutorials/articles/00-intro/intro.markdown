# Introduction [](id=tutorials)

Welcome to Liferay Tutorials! 
These tutorials show you how to build powerful robust apps using the
Liferay's tools, frameworks and APIs. The tutorials compliment the fundamentals
that you can master in Liferay's
[Learning Paths](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/welcome),
giving you keen insight into development features for building top-notch apps,
designing stylish themes, and customizing Liferay Portal to meet your needs. The
tutorials cover the following three main areas. 

- Using Liferay Development Tools
- Developing Liferay Applications
- Styling and Customizing Liferay

First, consider the tools Liferay provides to make your job easier.

#### Using Liferay Development Tools

If you're a newcomer, the wide variety of tools available can be overwhelming.
Throughout these tutorials, we'll show you how to develop plugins in three
environments that use open source technologies 1) An Ant-based command-line
environment that integrates with a wide variety of tools. 2) An easy-to-use IDE
that minimizes your learning curve while giving you powerful development
features. 3) An widely adopted project management system called Maven. The
Liferay Developer Network provides learning paths and tutorials that teach you
how to use these three environments. 

If I don't like Eclipse and prefer to use NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA or other
another IDE, there are many IDEs available, and each one has its strengths. You
can develop portal apps in whatever environment you like. 

#### Developing Liferay Applications

As a developer wanting to run your own applications on top of Liferay Portal,
you probably want to know *what's the best and quickest way to do it?* Liferay
supports two main, standards-based technologies for incorporating your
applications into Liferay: **Portlets** and **OpenSocial gadgets**. Portlets can
be written using any of the Java web frameworks that support portlet
development, including Liferay's MVC Portlet framework and JavaServer&#8482;
Faces (JSF).

As you write apps you'll want to leverage powerful frameworks components that
work seamlessly with Liferay. Liferay contains several frameworks that give you
all the tools you need to perform various common tasks, such has handling
permissions, letting users enter comments, categories, and tags, and other
common tasks that Liferay doesn't make you have to write yourself.
<!--Here are just
a few of the framework topics the tutorials cover in detail.

In addition to Liferay's frameworks, you'll want to check out the powerful
taglibs and snazzy UI components that
[AlloyUI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/alloyui) and
[Liferay UI Taglibs](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-ui-taglibs)
provide.

#### Styling and Customizing Liferay

And what about the look and feel you want to develop for your sites and
customizations you want to do to Liferay's built-in features? Creating themes
and customizations is easy in Liferay. 

Now that you're oriented with what Liferay Tutorials offers, it's time to
discover new things as you develop sites in Liferay. 

To get you started, here are links to topics in the three areas
discussed on this page.
