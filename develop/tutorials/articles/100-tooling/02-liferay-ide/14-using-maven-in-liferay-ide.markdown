# Using Maven in Liferay @ide@ [](id=using-maven-in-liferay-ide)

You can take full advantage of Maven in Liferay @ide@ with its built-in Maven
support. In this tutorial, you'll learn about the following topics:

- [Installing Maven Plugins for Liferay @ide@](#installing-maven-plugins-for-liferay-ide)
- [Creating Maven Projects](#creating-maven-projects)
- [Importing Maven Projects](#importing-maven-projects)
- [Using the POM Graphic Editor](#using-the-pom-graphic-editor)

First you'll install the necessary Maven plugins for Liferay @ide@.

## Installing Maven Plugins for Liferay @ide@ [](id=installing-maven-plugins-for-liferay-ide)

In order to support Maven projects in @ide@ properly, you first need a mechanism
to recognize Maven projects as Liferay @ide@ projects. @ide@ projects are
recognized in Eclipse as faceted web projects that include the appropriate
Liferay plugin facet. Therefore, all @ide@ projects are also Eclipse web
projects (faceted projects with the web facet installed). In order for @ide@
to recognize the Maven project and for it to be able to leverage Java EE tooling
features (e.g., the Servers view) with the project, the project must be a
flexible web project. Liferay @ide@ relies on the following Eclipse plugins to
provide this capability:

- `m2e` (Maven integration for Eclipse)
- `m2e-wtp` (Maven integration for WTP)

All you have to do is install them so you can begin developing Maven projects
for @product@.

When first installing Liferay @ide@, the installation startup screen lets you
select whether you'd like to install the Maven plugins automatically. Don't
worry if you missed this during setup. You'll learn how to install the required
Maven plugins for @ide@ manually below.

1.  Navigate to *Help* &rarr; *Install New Software*. In the *Work with* field,
    insert the following value:

        Liferay IDE repository - http://releases.liferay.com/tools/ide/latest/stable/

2.  Check the *Liferay IDE Maven Support* option. This bundles all the required
    Maven plugins you need to begin developing Maven projects for @product@.

    ![Figure 1: You can install all the necessary Maven plugins for @ide@ by installing the *Liferay IDE Maven Support* option.](../../../images/maven-install-ide-plugins.png)

    If the *Liferay IDE Maven Support* option does not appear, then it's already
    installed. To verify that it's installed, uncheck the *Hide items that are
    already installed* checkbox and look for *Liferay IDE Maven Support* in the
    list of installed plugins. Also, if you'd like to view everything that is
    bundled with the *Liferay IDE Maven Support* option, uncheck the *Group
    items by category* checkbox.

3.  Click *Next*, review the install details, accept the term and license
    agreements, and select *Finish*.

<!--
Both Maven and Eclipse have their own standard build project lifecycles that are
independent from each other. For both to work together and run seamlessly within
Liferay IDE, a lifecycle mapping is required to link both lifecycles into one
combined lifecycle. Normally, this would have to be done manually by the user.
Fortunately, the m2e-liferay plugin combines the lifecycle metadata mapping and
Eclipse build lifecycles, to provide a seamless user experience. The lifecycle
mappings for your project can be viewed by right-clicking your project and
selecting Properties &rarr; Maven &rarr; Lifecycle Mapping.

Awesome! Your @ide@ is ready to develop Maven projects for @product@!

You'll learn about creating Maven projects in @ide@ next.

## Creating Maven Projects [](id=creating-maven-projects)

You can create a Maven project based on Liferay's provided Maven archetypes.

1.  Navigate to *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Module Project*.

2.  Give your project a name, select the `Maven` build type, and choose the
    project template (archetype) to use.

    ![Figure 2: The New Liferay Module Project wizard lets you generate a Maven project.](../../../images/create-maven-ide-project.png)

3.  (Optional) Click *Next* and name your component class name and package. You
    can also specify your component class's properties in the Properties menu.

4.  Click *Finish*.

That's it! You've created a Liferay module project using Maven!

If you created your Maven project outside of @ide@ with another tool, you can
still manage that project in @ide@, but you must first import it. You'll learn
how to do this next.

## Importing Maven Projects [](id=importing-maven-projects)

To import a pre-existing Maven project into Liferay @ide@, follow the steps
outlined below:

1.  Navigate to *File* &rarr; *Import* &rarr; *Maven* &rarr; *Existing Maven
    Projects* and click *Next*.

    ![Figure 3: @ide@ offers the Maven folder in the Import wizard.](../../../images/import-maven-project.png)

2.  Click *Browse...* and select the root folder for your Maven project. Once
    you've selected it, the `pom.xml` for that project should be visible in the
    Projects menu.

    ![Figure 4: Use the Import Maven Projects wizard to import your pre-existing project.](../../../images/select-maven-import.png)

3.  Click *Finish*.

Now your Maven project is available from the Package Explorer. Next you'll learn
about Liferay @ide@'s POM graphical editor.

### Using the POM Graphic Editor [](id=using-the-pom-graphic-editor)

You're provided a nifty POM graphic editor when opening your Maven project's
`pom.xml` in Liferay @ide@. This gives you several different ways to leverage
the power of Maven in your project:

- **Overview:** provides a graphical interface where you can add to and edit the
  `pom.xml` file.

- **Dependencies:** provides a graphical interface for adding and editing
  dependencies in your project, as well as modifying the `dependencyManagement`
  section of the `pom.xml` file.

- **Effective POM:** provides a read-only version of your project POM merged
  with its parent POM(s), `settings.xml`, and the settings in Eclipse for Maven.

- **Dependency Hierarchy:** provides a hierarchical view of project dependencies
  and an interactive listing of resolved dependencies.

- **pom.xml:** provides an editor for your POM's source XML.

The figure below shows the `pom.xml` file editor and its modes.

![Figure 5: Liferay @ide@ provides five interactive modes to help you edit and organize your POM..](../../../images/pom-editor-features.png)

By taking advantage of these interactive modes, Liferay @ide@ makes modifying
and organizing your POM and its dependencies a snap!
