    required. It is an enhanced version of the Java Environment used for
    developing new Java technology. You can download the Java SE JDK from the
    Java
    [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    page. 

2.  Download
    [Liferay @ide@](https://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-projects/liferay-ide).
