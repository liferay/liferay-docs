# Deploying Projects with Liferay @ide@ [](id=deploying-projects-with-liferay-ide)

Deploying projects in Liferay @ide@ is a cinch. Before deploying your project,
make sure you have a Liferay server configured in @ide@. To see how to do this,
see the
[Installing a Server in Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-a-server-in-liferay-ide)

There are two ways to deploy a project to your Liferay server. You should start
your Liferay server before attempting to deploy to it.

1.  Select the project from the Package Explorer window and drag it to your
    Liferay server in the Servers window.

2.  Right-click the server from the Servers window and select *Add and
    Remove...*. Add the project(s) you'd like to deploy from the Available
    window to the Configured window. Then click *Finish*.

**Note:** For a legacy Maven application, you were able to deploy it by
right-clicking it in the Package Explorer and selecting *Liferay* &rarr; *Maven*
&rarr; *liferay:deploy*. This is no longer possible because Liferay's Maven
archetypes no longer rely on the legacy `liferay-maven-plugin`. To deploy Maven
projects in @ide@, make sure to follow the methods described above.

If you run into errors during the build/deploy process of your project, check to
make sure your Liferay Workspace is accounting for the
[appropriate certificates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-a-liferay-workspace#certification-issues-in-liferay-workspace).

That's it! Once your project is deployed to the Liferay server, you can verify
its installation in @ide@'s Console window.
