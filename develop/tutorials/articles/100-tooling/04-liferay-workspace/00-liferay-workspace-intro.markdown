# Liferay Workspace [](id=liferay-workspace)

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your Liferay projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create @product-ver@ modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace. Do
you prefer Maven over Gradle? See the
[Maven Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/maven-workspace)
tutorial to learn about using Liferay Workspace with Maven.

Liferay Workspaces can be used in many different development environments, which
makes it flexible and applicable to many different developers. You can download
the
[Liferay Workspace installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Workspace)
and run it to install
[Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli) (default CLI for
workspace) and initialize a new Liferay Workspace.

You can also use it with other developer IDEs. For example, a Liferay Workspace
easily integrates with Liferay @ide@, providing a seamless development
experience. To learn more about Liferay @ide@ and using workspace with it, see
the
[Creating a Liferay Workspace with Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace-with-liferay-ide)
tutorial.

Your workspace also offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage
the generated folders. There are also some folders that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's folder structure any way you'd like. To learn more
info on a workspace's folder structure and how you can configure a workspace,
see the
[Configuring a Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-a-liferay-workspace)
tutorial.

Liferay Workspaces offer a full development lifecycle for your modules to make
your Liferay development easier than ever. The development lifecycle includes
creating, building, deploying, testing, and releasing modules. To learn more
about the development lifecycle of a Liferay Workspace, see the
[Development Lifecycle for a Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/development-lifecycle-for-a-liferay-workspace)
tutorial.
