# Creating a Liferay Workspace [](id=creating-a-liferay-workspace)

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your @product@ projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create Liferay 7.0 modules
using Gradle. For those developers that still want to develop WAR-style plugins
using the Plugins SDK, this way is also supported using a Liferay Workspace.

Your workspace offers Gradle properties that you can modify to help manage the
generated folders. There are also some folders that aren't generated by
default, but can be manually created and set. This provides you the power to
customize your workspace's folder structure any way you'd like.

For this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate a Liferay Workspace using Blade
CLI. You can also create a Liferay Workspace using Liferay IDE, which runs on
Blade tools behind the scenes. Liferay IDE gives you a graphical interface
instead of the command prompt, which can streamline your workflow. Before
attempting to create a Liferay Workspace via Blade CLI in the command prompt,
make sure you've installed Blade, which is covered in the section
[Installing Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli).

The instructions covered in this tutorial apply to both the commercial and open 
source versions of Liferay.

Buckle up! You're about to create your own Liferay 7.0 Workspace!

## Using Blade CLI to Create Your Workspace [](id=using-blade-to-create-your-workspace)

The Blade CLI tool you installed in the previous sub-section provides many
different commands to help build and customize Liferay projects. The first thing
you should do before building and customizing projects is create a Liferay
Workspace. Your workspace is the home for all your custom Liferay projects.
Navigate to the folder where you want your workspace and run the following
command:

    blade init [WORKSPACE_NAME]

If you still plan on using a Plugins SDK and wish to use it in conjunction with
a workspace, navigate to your Plugins SDK root folder and run the following
command:

    blade init -f

This command builds a workspace and automatically adds and configures your
current Plugins SDK environment for use inside the workspace. See the
[Using a Plugins SDK From Your Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#using-a-plugins-sdk-from-your-workspace)
section for more information on how to use a Plugins SDK from within a
workspace.

Once your workspace is generated, look at its folder structure. Several folders
and build/properties files were autogenerated: 

`modules`: holds your custom modules which are built using the `blade create`
command. To learn more about building modules, see the
[Creating Modules with Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-modules-with-blade-cli).
tutorial.

`themes`: holds your custom themes which are built using the Theme Generator.

`configs`: holds the configuration files for different environments. These
files serve as your global configuration files for all Liferay servers and
projects residing in your workspace. 

`gradle`: holds the Gradle Wrapper used by your workspace.

The build/properties files included in your workspace's root directory sets your
workspace's Gradle properties and facilitates the build processes of your
modules.

You'll learn about how to use these folders and properties files throughout the
next few tutorials. Before you begin using your workspace, it's a good practice
to set your workspace Gradle properties in the `gradle.properties` file. There
are several commented out properties in this file. These are the default
properties set in your workspace. If you'd like to change a variable, uncomment
the variable and set it to a custom value. For instance, if you want to store
your modules in a folder other than `[ROOT]/modules`, uncomment the
`liferay.workspace.modules.dir` variable and set it to a different value.

**Note:** The workspace plugin automatically adds a multitude of subprojects for
you, which hides some complexities of Gradle. For example, a typical project's
`settings.gradle` file could contain many included subprojects like this:

    ...
    include images:base:oracle-jdk:oracle-jdk-6
    include images:base:oracle-jdk:oracle-jdk-7
    include images:base:oracle-jdk:oracle-jdk-8
    include images:base:liferay-portal:liferay-portal-ce-tomcat-7.0-ga1
    include images:source-bundles:glassfish
    include images:source-bundles:jboss-eap
    include images:source-bundles:tomcat
    include images:source-bundles:websphere
    include images:source-bundles:wildfly
    include compose:jboss-eap-mysql
    include compose:tomcat-mariadb
    include compose:tomcat-mysql
    include compose:tomcat-mysql-elastic
    include compose:tomcat-postgres
    include file-server
    ...

The workspace plugin provides these behind the scenes. Likewise, if a folder in
the `/themes` folder includes a `liferay-theme.json` file, the `gulp` plugin is
applied to it. If a folder in the `/modules` folder included a `bnd.bnd` file,
the `liferay-gradle` plugin is applied to it. Therefore, workspaces provides an
easier way to create and manage Gradle plugins. For more information on the
`liferay-gradle` plugin, see the
[Liferay Sample Modules](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-sample-modules)
tutorial.

Once you've developed and managed projects in your workspace, it could also be
usefuly to bundle your workspace into a ZIP or TAR file. This provides the
flexibility to distribute your workspace to potential consumers. To do this,
navigate to your workspace's root folder and run the following:

    ./gradlew distBundle[Zip|Tar]

Your distribution file is available from the workspace's `/build` directory.

Next you'll learn about generating and using a @product@ instance from within your
workspace.

## Running a Liferay Instance from Your Workspace [](id=running-a-liferay-instance-from-your-workspace)

Liferay Workspaces can generate and hold a Liferay Server. This lets you
build/test your plugins against a running Liferay instance. Before generating a
Liferay instance, open the `gradle.properties` file located in your workspace's
root folder. There are several configurable properties for your workspace's
Liferay instance. For instance, you can set the version of Liferay you'd like to
generate and install (e.g., `7.0-ce-ga1`).

Once you've finalized your Gradle properties, navigate to your workspace's root
folder and run

    gradlew initBundle

As you read earlier, the workspace uses a Gradle wrapper to download and use
Gradle build tools. This command downloads the version of Liferay you specified
in your Gradle properties and installs your Liferay instance in the `bundles`
folder. To start your Liferay instance, run

    blade server start -b

This command starts your Liferay server in a separate window. You also have the
option to run your server in debug mode (`-d`).

Awesome! You have a built-in Liferay server in your workspace and can start the
server using Blade CLI. Next you'll learn how to use a legacy Plugins SDK from
your workspace.

### Using a Plugins SDK from Your Workspace [](id=using-a-plugins-sdk-from-your-workspace)

Because @product@ 7.0 uses a module-based framework, the current structure of a
Liferay Workspace is centered around module development. There are still,
however, many situations where you must create WAR-style plugins using the
Plugins SDK. Because of this, your workspace can also work with the Plugins SDK.
When configuring your SDK in a workspace, you can take advantage of all the new
functionality workspaces provide and also use the SDK environment that you're
used to. To learn more about how to convert legacy applications to 7.0 modules
and what you should consider before making the jump, visit the
[Modularizing an Existing Portlet](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/modularizing-an-existing-portlet)
tutorial.

If you used the `blade init -f` command to generate your workspace, your Plugins
SDK is already configured to use. If you created your workspace from scratch and
want to use a Plugins SDK, follow the instructions below.

If you revisit your workspace's `gradle.properties` file, you'll notice the
Plugins SDK folder is set to `plugins-sdk`. This folder was not generated by
default, so you must create it yourself. In your workspace's root
folder, create the `plugins-sdk` folder. Then copy your legacy Plugins SDK
files into the `plugins-sdk` folder.

One last thing you must do to ensure the Plugins SDK works properly in the
context of your workspace is to generate all its requirements. These
requirements include the build JARs the Plugins SDK relies on to function
properly. To download the necessary requirements for your Plugins SDK, run the
following command from your workspace's root folder:

    gradlew tasks

Once the downloading is complete, your Plugins SDK is ready to use in your
workspace. It's as simple as that!

Next you'll learn about using Liferay Workspaces in Liferay IDE.

## Using Liferay IDE to Create Your Workspace [](id=using-liferay-ide-to-create-your-workspace)

Using Blade CLI is a great option for doing things fast and with little
overhead. There are, however, developers who prefer using an IDE with a nice
GUI. If you're one of those developers, Liferay provides the same workspace
functionality through Liferay IDE. If you're curious about the directory
structure and configuration files in a Liferay Workspace, visit the
[Using Blade to Create Your Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace#using-blade-to-create-your-workspace)
section.

To create a Liferay Workspace in IDE, select *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay
Workspace Project*.

![Figure 1: By selecting *Liferay Workspace*, you begin the process of creating a new workspace for your Liferay projects.](../../../images/selecting-liferay-workspace.png)

A *New Liferay Workspace* popup window appears, presenting several configuration
options. Follow the instructions below to create your workspace.

1. Give your workspace a name. 

2. Choose the location where you'd like your workspace to reside. Checking the
   *Use default location* checkbox places your Liferay Workspace in the Eclipse
   workspace you're working in.

3. Check the *Download Liferay bundle* checkbox if you'd like to auto-generate a
   Liferay instance in your workspace. You'll be prompted to name the server, if
   selected. This Liferay bundle is generated the same way as described in the
   previous section.

    +$$$

    **Note:** If you'd like to configure a pre-existing Liferay bundle to your
    workspace, you can create a directory for the bundle in your workspace and
    configure it in the workspace's `gradle.properties` file by setting the
    `liferay.workspace.home.dir` property.

    $$$

4. Check the *Add project to working set* checkbox if you'd like the workspace
to be a part of a larger working set you've already created in IDE. For more
information on working sets, visit
[Eclipse Help](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcworkset.htm).

5. Click *Finish* to create your Liferay Workspace.

![Figure 2: Liferay IDE provides an easy-to-follow menu to create your Liferay Workspace.](../../../images/new-workspace-menu.png)

A popup window appears prompting you to open the *Liferay Workspace*
perspective. Click *Yes*, and your perspective will switch to *Liferay
Workspace*.

The *Liferay Workspace* perspective is intended for Gradle development for
Liferay 7 modules. Since Liferay Workspaces are used for Gradle based
development and the *Liferay* workspace is intended for the Plugins SDK and Ant
based development, the two perspectives are independent of each other.

![Figure 3: The Liferay Workspace perspective is preferred for Liferay 7 and OSGi module development.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-perspective.png)

You'll find your new workspace in the Project Explorer and your Liferay server
(if you created it) in the Servers menu. It's important to note that an Eclipse
workspace can only have one Liferay Workspace project.

![Figure 4: An IDE workspace only supports one Liferay Workspace project. If you create another, you'll be given an error message.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-duplicate.png)

You can configure your workspace's module presentation by switching between the
default *Hierarchical* or *Flat* views. To do this, navigate to the Project
Explorer's *View Menu* (![View Menu](../../../images/icon-ide-view-menu.png))
and select *Projects Presentation* and then the presentation mode you'd like to
display. The Hierarchical view displays subfolders and subprojects under the
workspace project, whereas the Flat view displays the workspace's modules
separately from the workspace.

![Figure 5: The Hierarchical project presentation mode is set, by default.](../../../images/workspace-presentation.png)

If you've already created a Liferay Workspace and you'd like to import into your
existing IDE, you can do so by navigating to *File* &rarr; *Import* &rarr;
*Liferay* &rarr; *Liferay Workspace Project*. Then click *Next* and browse for
your worspace project. Once you've selected you workspace, click *Finish*.

![Figure 5: You can import an existing Liferay Workspace into your current IDE session.](../../../images/liferay-workspace-import.png)

Congratulations! You've learned how to create a Liferay Workspace using the
command line and Liferay IDE. Now that your workspace is created, you can
begin creating Liferay plugins.
