# Maven [](id=maven)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a viable option for managing Liferay
projects if you don't want to use Liferay's default Gradle management system.
Liferay provides several Maven plugins to let you generate and manage your
project. Liferay also provides Maven artifacts that are easy to obtain and are
required for Liferay Maven module development. In the Maven tutorials, you'll
learn how to

- Install Liferay Maven artifacts.

<!--
- Generate Liferay Maven projects using archetypes.
- Create a Module JAR.
- Deploy a Maven project to @product@.
-->

- Manage Liferay Maven projects.
- Deploy a Liferay Maven project to a remote repository.

<!--
- Use Service Builder in a Liferay Maven project.
- Compile Sass files with Maven.
-->

Because Liferay is tool agnostic, Maven is fully supported for Liferay
development. Read on to learn more!
