# Tooling [](id=tooling)

You can write code for Liferay using any any standard toolset. Liferay is
tool-agnostic, rather than pigeonholing you into something specific. This frees
you to work with whatever you're already productive using.

Liferay has also created its own tools that streamline @product@ development.
These tools integrate with popular build environments (e.g., Gradle and Maven).
They include

- [Liferay @ide@](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/liferay-ide): an
  Eclipse-based IDE supporting development for @product@.
- [Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli): a command line
  interface bootstrapped on to a Gradle based environment that is used to build
  and manage Liferay Workspaces and @product@ projects.
- [Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-workspace):
  a generated environment built to hold and manage @product@ projects.

Liferay also provides a plethora of
[Gradle](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/gradle) and
[Maven plugins](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/maven) you can apply to
your projects. Many of these are already built into tools such as Liferay
Workspace.

Want samples or predefined project templates? Liferay has you covered with 30+
[project templates](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/project-templates)
and many more
[project samples](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/liferay-sample-projects).

If you're a newbie looking for the best development tool for @product@, or even
a seasoned veteran looking for a tool you may like more than your current setup,
this section will answer your tooling questions.
