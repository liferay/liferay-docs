# Deploying Projects with Blade CLI [](id=deploying-projects-with-blade-cli)

Deploying modules to a Liferay server using Blade CLI is easy. To use the Blade
`deploy` command, you must first have built a project to deploy. See the
[Creating Projects with Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-modules-with-blade-cli)
tutorials for more information about creating Liferay projects. Once you've
built a project, navigate to it in your terminal window and execute the following
command to deploy it to @product@:

    blade deploy

You can also deploy all projects in a folder by running the `deploy` command
from the parent folder (e.g., `[WORKSPACE_ROOT]/modules`).

When deploying a project using Blade CLI, the project is directly installed into
@product@'s OSGi container. This means, for example, that a deployed module
isn't stored in the `LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/modules` folder; only modules copied to
the `LIFERAY_HOME/deploy` folder (i.e., leveraging the auto deployment
mechanism) are stored there. A module deployed by Blade CLI is stored only as
bytecode in `LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/state/org.eclipse.osgi` in a subfolder named
after its bundle ID. All modules installed in OSGi's registry are stored this
way, even those copied to the `/deploy` folder. Visit the
[Using the Felix Gogo Shell](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-felix-gogo-shell)
article for instructions on finding a bundle's ID.

The `deploy` command is intended for modules that are built into a JAR file. If
you've created a WAR style project (e.g., projects based on the Blade templates
`spring-mvc-portlet`, `theme`, etc.), you'll need to deploy it using a different
tool like Gradle (e.g., `./gradlew deploy`).

If you run into errors during the build/deploy process of your project, check to
make sure your workspace is accounting for the
[appropriate certificates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-a-liferay-workspace#certification-issues-in-liferay-workspace).

Blade CLI can detect a locally running Liferay instance and automatically
deploys your project to that Liferay instance. Blade communicates with
@product@'s OSGi framework using Felix Gogo shell and deploys the project
directly to the OSGi container using Felix File Install commands. The command
uses the default `11311` port by default.

<!--
You can also specify a custom port to deploy your module to using the `-p`
parameter followed by the port number. For instance, you could run `blade deploy
-p 8090` to deploy to port 8090.

<!-- Follow BLADE-189 for info on supporting host and port commands for Blade
deployment. -Cody -->

You can also watch the deployed module for changes by specifying the `-w`
parameter.

    blade deploy -w

This parameter automatically redeploys the module when changes are detected.

**Note:** The `blade deploy` command requires a Gradle/Maven wrapper to
successfully execute. To ensure the availability of a build tool wrapper, be
sure to work in a Liferay Workspace. For more information on Liferay Workspaces,
see the
[Creating a Liferay Workspace with Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-a-liferay-workspace-with-blade-cli)
tutorial.

Cool! You've successfully deployed your module project using Blade CLI.
