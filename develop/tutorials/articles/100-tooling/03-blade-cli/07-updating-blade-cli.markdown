# Updating Blade CLI [](id=updating-blade-cli)

If your Blade CLI version is outdated, you can run the following command to
automatically download and install the latest version of Blade CLI:

    blade update

For Windows users, the `blade update` command does not work because Windows
cannot update a file that is currently in use. To bypass this issue, you can use
JPM to update your version of Blade CLI:

    jpm install -f https://releases.liferay.com/tools/blade-cli/latest/blade.jar

Blade CLI is updated frequently, so it's recommended to update your Blade CLI
environment for new features. You can check the released versions of Blade CLI
at [https://releases.liferay.com/tools/blade-cli/](https://releases.liferay.com/tools/blade-cli/).
You can check your current installed version by running `blade version`. 

**Important:** If you run `blade version` after updating, but don't see the
expected version installed, you may have two separate Blade CLI installations on
your machine. This is typically caused if you installed an earlier version of
Blade CLI, and then used the
[Liferay Workspace installer](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-blade-cli)
(at any time prior) to update the older Blade CLI instance. This is not
recommended. Doing this installs Blade CLI in the global and user home folder of
your machine. The latest Blade CLI update process installs to your user home
folder, so you must delete the legacy Blade files in your global folder, if
present. To do this, navigate to your `GLOBAL_FOLDER/JPM4J` folder and delete

- `/bin/blade`
- `/commands/blade`

The newest Blade CLI installation in your user home folder is now recognized and
available.

Awesome! You've successfully learned how to update Blade CLI.
