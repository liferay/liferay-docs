# Security and Permissions [](id=security-and-permissions)

The Java portlet standard defines a simple security scheme using portlet roles and
their mapping to portal roles. On top of that, Liferay provides a fine-grained
permissions system you can use to implement access security in your custom
portlets. Here we'll give an overview of the standard Java security system,
Liferay's permission system, and how to use them in your own portlets. 

## JSR Portlet Security [](id=jsr-portlet-security)

The JSR specification defines a means to specify roles used by portlets in their
`portlet.xml` definitions. The role names themselves, however, are not
standardized, so when these portlets run in Liferay, you'll recognize familiar
role names. For example, the Liferay Blogs portlet definition references the
*guest*, *power-user*, and *user* roles: 

	<portlet>
		<portlet-name>33</portlet-name>
		<display-name>Blogs</display-name>
		<portlet-class>com.liferay.portlet.StrutsPortlet</portlet-class>
		<init-param>
			<name>view-action</name>
			<value>/blogs/view</value>
		</init-param>
		<init-param>
			<name>config-jsp</name>
			<value>/html/portlet/blogs/configuration.jsp</value>
		</init-param>
		<expiration-cache>0</expiration-cache>
		<supports>
			<mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
		</supports>
		<resource-bundle>com.liferay.portlet.StrutsResourceBundle</resource-bundle>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>guest</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>power-user</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<security-role-ref>
			<role-name>user</role-name>
		</security-role-ref>
		<supported-public-render-parameter>categoryId</supported-public-render-parameter>
		<supported-public-render-parameter>tag</supported-public-render-parameter>
	</portlet>

Your `portlet.xml` roles need to be mapped to specific roles in the portal.
That way the portal can resolve conflicts between roles with the same name that
are from different portlets (e.g. portlets from different developers). 

+$$$

**Note:** Each role named in a portlet's `<security-role-ref>` element is given
permission to add the portlet to a page. 

$$$

To map the roles to the portal, you'll have to use a Liferay-specific
configuration file called `liferay-portlet.xml`. For an example, see the mapping
defined inside `liferay-portlet.xml` found in `portal-web/docroot/WEB-INF`: 

    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>administrator</role-name>
        <role-link>Administrator</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>guest</role-name>
        <role-link>Guest</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>power-user</role-name>
        <role-link>Power User</role-link>
    </role-mapper>
    <role-mapper>
        <role-name>user</role-name>
        <role-link>User</role-link>
    </role-mapper>

<!-- Better to use an example from plugins here, rather than from an internal
portlet. -Rich -->

If a portlet definition references the role `power-user`, that portlet is
mapped to the Liferay role called *Power User* that's already in its database. 

Once roles are mapped to the portal, you can use methods as defined in portlet
specification: 

- `getRemoteUser()`
- `isUserInRole()`
- `getUserPrincipal()`

For example, you can use the following code to check if the current user has
the `power-user` role:

    if (renderRequest.isUserInRole("power-user")) {
        // ...
    }

By default, Liferay doesn't use the `isUserInRole()` method in any built-in
portlets. Liferay uses its own permission system directly to achieve more
fine-grained security. Next we'll describe Liferay's permission system and
how to use it in your portlets. We recommend using Liferay's permission system,
because it offers a much more robust way of tailoring your application's
permissions. 

## Liferay's Permission System [](id=liferays-permission-system)

You can add permissions to your custom portlets using four easy steps (also
known as DRAC): 

1. **D**efine all resources and their permissions. 

2. **R**egister all defined resources in the permissions system. This is also
   known as *adding resources*. 

3. **A**ssociate the necessary permissions with resources.

4. **C**heck permission before returning resources. 

Before you start adding permissions to a portlet, make sure you understand
these two critical terms used throughout this section: 

- *Resource*: A generic term for any object represented in the portal.
  Examples of resources include portlets (e.g. Message Boards, Calendar, etc.),
Java classes (e.g. Message Board Topics, Calendar Events, etc.), and files
(e.g.  documents, images, etc.). 
- *Permission*: An action on a resource. For example, the *view* action with
respect to *viewing the calendar portlet* is defined as a permission in Liferay.

It's important to know that permissions for *portlet* resources are implemented
a little differently than for other resources like Java classes and files.
Below, we'll describe permission implementation for the *portlet* resource
first, followed by the model resource. 

<!-- We definitely should not be using the Blogs portlet to illustrate this, as
the patterns are different from what plugin developers would do. For example, in
a plugin, the convention is to create default.xml in the resource-actions folder
of a plugin, and that's what developers reading this will do. We should find
another portlet to serve as our example portlet. -Rich -->

The first step is to define your resources and the actions that can be defined
on them. Let's use the Blogs portlet to demonstrate. Open the `blogs.xml` file in
`portal-impl/src/resource-actions` and you'll see the following mapping of
resources to actions:

            </permissions>
            ...
        </model-resource>
    </resource-action-mapping>

Permissions in the blogs portlet are defined at two different levels: the
portlet level and the model level. The portlet level defines permissions on the
portlet as a whole. The model level defines permissions on the model layer of
the application, as defined by the entities in the application. Each level
coincides with a section of the `resource-actions` XML file (in this case,
`blogs.xml`). 

At the `<portlet-resource>` level, actions and default permissions
are defined on the portlet itself. Changes to portlet level permissions are
performed on a per-site basis, and define whether users can add the portlet to a
page, edit the portlet's configuration, or view the portlet.  All these actions
are defined in the `<supports>` tag for the portlet resource's permissions. The
default portlet-level permissions for members of the site are defined in the
`<site-member-defaults>` tag. In the case of the Blogs portlet, site members can
view any blog in the site. Similarly, default guest permissions are defined in
the `<guest-defaults>` tag. The `<guest-unsupported>` tag contains permissions
forbidden to guests. Here, guests can't be given permission to configure the
portlet. 

The `<model-resource>` section contains the next level of permissions, based on
the *scope* of an individual instance of the portlet. A scope in Liferay
refers to how widely the data from an instance of a portlet is shared. For
example, if you place a Blogs portlet on a page in the guest site and place
another Blogs portlet on another page in the same site, the two blogs share the
same set of posts. That happens because portlets are given a site level scope by
default. If you reconfigure one of the two Blogs and change its scope to be the
current page, that Blogs portlet instance no longer shares content with the
other instance (or any other Blogs instance in that site). A portlet instance's
scope-based permissions can thus span an entire site or be restricted to a
single page. If you set the scope to the page, it's possible to have multiple
distinct Blog instances within a site, each with different permissions for site
users. For example, a food site could have one blog open to posts from any site
member, but also have a separate informational blog about the site itself
restricted to posts from administrators. 

After defining the portlet and portlet instance as resources, we need to define
permissions on the models in the portlet. The model resource is surrounded by
the `<model-resource>` tag. Inside the tag, we first define the model name; the
`<model-name>` isn't the name of a Java class, but the fully qualified name of
the portlet's package (e.g. the blog portlet's package
`com.liferay.portlet.blogs`). This is the recommended convention for permissions
that refer to an instance of the portlet as a whole. Permissions like the
ability to *add* or *subscribe to* a blog entry are defined here, and affect the
portlet at the instance level. The `<portlet-ref>` element comes next and
contains a `<portlet-name>`. The value of `<portlet-name>` references the name
of the portlet to which the model resource belongs. Theoretically, a model
resource can belong to multiple portlets referenced with multiple
`<portlet-name>` elements, but this is uncommon. Like the portlet resource, the
model resource lets you define a list of supported actions that require
permission to perform. You must list all the performable actions that require a
permission check. For a blog entry, users must belong to appropriate roles for
permission to do the following: 

- *Add comments* to an entry 
- *Delete* an entry 
- *Change the permission* setting of an entry 
- *Update* an entry 
- *View* an entry 

As with a portlet resource, the `<site-member-defaults>` tag, `<guest-defaults>`
tag, and `<guest-unsupported>` tag define default permissions for site members
and guests, respectively, for *model resources*. 

After defining resource permissions for your custom portlet, you need to refer
Liferay to the `resource-actions` XML file that contains your definitions (e.g.
`blogs.xml` for the Blogs portlet). For Liferay core, the `resource-actions`
XML files are in the `portal/portal-impl/src/resource-actions` directory
and the file named `default.xml` file refers to each of these files. This
excerpt from `default.xml` references the resource permission definition files
for all built-in Liferay portlets (including the blogs portlet): 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE resource-action-mapping PUBLIC "-//Liferay//DTD Resource Action Mapping 6.1.0//EN" "http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-resource-action-mapping_6_1_0.dtd">
	
    <resource-action-mapping>
        <resource file="resource-actions/portal.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/announcements.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/asset.xml" />
        <resource file="resource-actions/blogs.xml" />
        ...
    </resource-action-mapping>

You should put your plugin's `resource-actions` XML files (e.g.  `default.xml`
and `blogs.xml`) in a directory in your project's classpath. Then create a
properties file (typically named `portlet.properties`) for your portlet that
references the the file that specifies your `<resource-action-mapping>` element
(e.g. `default.xml`). In this portlet properties file, create a property
named `resource.actions.configs` with the relative path to your portlet's
resource-action mapping file (e.g.  `default.xml`) as its value. Here's what
this property specification might look like: 

    resource.actions.configs=resource-actions/default.xml

Check out a copy of the Liferay source code from the Liferay Github repository
to see an example of a portlet that defines its resources and permissions as we
just described; start by looking at the definition files found in the
`portal-impl/src/resource-actions` directory. For an example of defining
permissions in the context of a portlet plugin, check out `plugins/trunk` and
look at the portlet `sample-permissions-portlet`. 

Next we'll show you how to add resources. 

<!-- I didn't see any point to the permission algorithms section. It didn't seem
to lead anywhere, and developers who have been approaching Liferay have been met
with a default Algorithm 6 for two releases now. Algorithm 6 is now required for
the proper operation of Liferay, so the only people who need to worry about the
older algorithms are those who are upgrading, and we cover that in the upgrading
section of the User Guide. The API described below works the same regardless of
which permissions algorithm is used. For these reasons, I removed the whole
section. It seems to improve the flow: we just left off talking about portal
resources in the XML file, and now it goes right into the code. -Rich -->

## Adding a Resource [](id=adding-a-resource)

After defining resources and actions, it's time to add resources into the
permissions system. Resources are added at the same time entities are added to
the database. Managing resources follows the same pattern you've seen throughout
Liferay: there's a service to use. Adding resources is as easy as calling the
`addResources(...)` method of the `ResourceLocalServiceUtil` class. Here's the
signature of that method: 

    public void addResources(
        long companyId, long groupId, long userId, String name,
        String primKey, boolean portletActions,
        boolean addGroupPermissions, boolean addGuestPermissions)

Each Entity that requires access permission must be added as a resource
every time it is stored. For example, every time a user adds a new
entry to her blog, the `addResources(...)` method must be called to add the
new entry object to the resource system. Here's an example of the call from the
`BlogsEntryLocalServiceImpl` class: 

    resourceLocalService.addResources(
        entry.getCompanyId(), entry.getGroupId(), entry.getUserId(),
        BlogsEntry.class.getName(), entry.getEntryId(), false,
        addGroupPermissions, addGuestPermissions);

In the `addResources(...)` method, the parameters `companyId`, `groupId`, and
`userId` correspond to the portal instance, the site in which the entity is
being saved, and the user who is saving it. Let's look more closely at the
remaining parameters: 

- The `name` parameter is the fully qualified Java class name for the 
  entity being added. 
- The `primKey` parameter is the primary key of the entity. 
- The `portletActions` parameter should be set to `true` if you're adding
  portlet action permissions. In our example, it's `false` because we're adding
  a model resource, which should be associated with permissions related to the
  model action defined in `blogs.xml`. 
- The `addGroupPermissions` and the `addGuestPermissions` parameters are inputs
  from the user. If set to `true`, `ResourceLocalService` adds the default
  permissions to the current group and the guest group for this resource,
  respectively. 

You can let your users choose whether to add the default site permission and/or
the guest permission for your custom portlet resources: Liferay has a custom
JSP tag `<liferay-ui:input-permissions />` that you can use to quickly add that
functionality. You just insert the tag into the appropriate JSP and the
checkboxes appear on that page. Make sure that the tag is inside the
appropriate `<form>` tags, and that's all there is to it. 

When you remove entities from the database, it's good practice to remove
permissions mapped directly to the entity. To prevent dead resources from
taking up space in the `Resource_` database table, remember to remove them from
the `Resource_` table when the resource no longer applies. Do this by calling
the `deleteResource(...)` method of `ResourceLocalServiceService`. Here's an
example of a blogs entry being removed: 

    resourceLocalService.deleteResource(
        entry.getCompanyId(), BlogsEntry.class.getName(),
        ResourceConstants.SCOPE_INDIVIDUAL, entry.getEntryId());

Great! Now that you know how to work with resource permissions, we'll show you
how to provide a user interface for managing resource permissions. 

## Adding Permission [](id=adding-permission)

On the portlet level, no code needs to be written in order to have the
permission system work for your custom portlet. If you've defined any custom
permissions (supported actions) in your configuration file's `portlet-resource`
tag, they're automatically added to a list of permissions in Liferay's
permissions UI. What good, however, are permissions that are available but can't
be set by users? 

To let a user set permissions on model resources, you must expose the permission
interface to the user. Just add these two Liferay UI tags to your JSP:

1.  `<liferay-security:permissionsURL>`: Returns a URL to the permission
    settings configuration page. 

2. `<liferay-ui:icon>`: Shows an icon to the user. These are defined in the
    theme, and one of them (see below) is used for permissions. 

This example demonstrates the use of both tags; it comes from the
`view_entry_content.jspf`file. 

    <liferay-security:permissionsURL
        modelResource="<%= BlogsEntry.class.getName() %>"
        modelResourceDescription="<%= entry.getTitle() %>"
        resourcePrimKey="<%= entry.getPrimaryKey().toString() %>"
        var="entryURL"
    />

    <liferay-ui:icon image="permissions" url="<%= entryURL %>" />

For the first tag, specify the following attributes: 

- `modelResource`: The fully qualified Java object class name. This class name
  gets translated into its more readable name as specified in
  `Language.properties`. 
- `modelResourceDescription`: You can pass in anything that best describes
  this model instance. In this example, the blogs title was passed in. 
- `resourcePrimKey`: The primary key of your model instance. 
- `var`: Specifies the name of the variable to be assigned the resulting URL
  String. The variable is then passed to the `<liferay-ui:icon>` tag so the
  permission icon has the proper URL link. 

There's an optional attribute called `redirect` that's available if you want to
override the default behavior of the upper right arrow link. That's it; now your
users can configure the permission settings for model resources. 

Next we'll show you how to implement permissions checking. 

## Checking Permissions [](id=checking-permissions)

The last major step toward implementing permissions for your custom portlet is
to ensure the configured permissions are enforced. You'll do this by adding
permission checks to your application. For example, your business layer can
check for permission before deleting a resource, or your user interface can hide
a button that adds an entity (e.g. a calendar event) if the user doesn't have
permission. 

You need to implement checking of any custom permissions you defined in your
`resource-actions` XML file. In the Blogs portlet, one supported custom action
is `ADD_ENTRY`. There are two places in the source code to check for this
permission: in your JSP files and in the business logic. For the JSP files, you
want to wrap certain elements in permission checks, so they only appear for
users with the permission to perform those functions. For example, the presence
of the Add Entry button is contingent on whether the user has permission to add
a blog entry.  Here's the `ADD_ENTRY` action in a JSP file: 

    <%
    if (permissionChecker.hasPermission(
        scopeGroupId, "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model",
        scopeGroupId, "ADD_ENTRY") {
        // Show add entry button
    }
    %>

The second place to check for the add entry permission is in the business
logic. If the check fails, a `PrincipalException` is thrown `and the add entry
request is aborted:`

    if (!permissionChecker.hasPermission(
        scopeGroupId, "com.liferay.portlet.blogs.model",
        scopeGroupId, "ADD_ENTRY")) {
            throw new PrincipalException();
    }

    blogsEntryLocalService.addEntry(...);

The `PermissionChecker` class has a method `hasPermission(...)` that checks
whether a user making a resource request has the necessary access permission.
If the user isn't signed in (guest user), it checks for guest permissions.
Otherwise, it checks for user permissions. Let's quickly review the parameters
of this method: 

-   `groupId`: Represents the scope where the permission check is performed. In
    Liferay, many scopes are available, including a specific site, organization,
    personal site of a user, or a page in a site. This is important because a
    user may be allowed to add blog entries in one site, but not in another. For
    resources that don't belong to a scope (extremely rare and unlikely), set
    the value of this parameter to `0`. There are several ways you can obtain
    the `groupId` of the current scope: 

    -   JSP that uses the `<theme:defineObjects/>` tag: there's an implicit
        variable called `scopeGroupId`.
    -   Business logic class: If you're using the ServiceContext pattern, you
        can obtain the `groupId` by using `serviceContext.getScopeGroupId()`. If
        you're not using the `ServiceContext` pattern, your can obtain `groupId`
        from the theme display request object: 

            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)request.getAttribute(
            WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);
            long scopeGroupId = themeDisplay.getScopeGroupId();

-   `name`: The name of the resource as specified in the XML file of the
    previous sections. 
-   `primKey`: The primary key of the resource. In this example the resource
    doesn't exist as an entry in the database, so we use the `groupId` again. If
    we were checking for a permission on a given blog entry, we'd use the
    primary key of that blog entry instead. 
-   `actionId`: The name of the action as it appears in the XML file. To
    simplify searching for usages, consider creating a helper class that has
    constants for all the actions defined. 

In the examples above, we're assuming there's a variable called
`permissionChecker` already available. Liferay automatically creates a
`PermissionChecker` instance that has the necessary information from the user
for every request. Liferay also caches the security checks to ensure good
performance. There are several ways to obtain a permission checker: 

-   In a JSP that uses the `<theme:defineObjects/>` tag, there's an implicit
    variable called `permissionChecker`. 
-   With Service Builder, every service implementation class can access the
    `PermissionChecker` instance by using the method `getPermissionChecker()`. 
-   If you're not using Service Builder, `PermissionChecker` can be obtained from
    the theme display request object: 

        ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)
            request.getAttribute(WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);
        PermissionChecker permissionChecker = themeDisplay.getPermissionChecker();

Next you'll optimize permission checking by creating helper classes to do most
of the heavy lifting.

### Creating Helper Classes for Permission Checking [](id=lp-6-1-dgen09-creating-helper-classes-for-permission-checking-0)

Helper classes streamline your code. They encapsulate the use of
`permissionChecker` and the names of the resources for a specific portlet. This
is especially useful when there are complex parent-child relationships, or if
your permission logic calls for checking multiple action types.
`BlogsPermission` is an example of a permission helper class. Here's how
`BlogsPermission` is used in a JSP: 

    <%
    if (BlogsPermission.contains(permissionChecker, scopeGroupId,
        ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY)) {
        // show add entry button
        }
    %>

Now let's see how a `ServiceImpl` class `BlogsEntryServiceImpl` uses the
`BlogsPermission` helper class. In the method
`BlogsEntryServiceImpl.addEntry(...)`, a call is made to check whether the
incoming request has permission to add an entry. The check is done using the
helper class `BlogsPermission`. If the check fails, it throws a
`PrincipalException` and the add entry request aborts. 

    public BlogsEntry addEntry(
        String title, String description, String content,
        int displayDateMonth, int displayDateDay, int displayDateYear,
        int displayDateHour, int displayDateMinute, boolean allowPingbacks,
        boolean allowTrackbacks, String[] trackbacks, boolean smallImage,
        String smallImageURL, String smallImageFileName,
        InputStream smallImageInputStream, ServiceContext serviceContext)
        throws PortalException, SystemException {

        BlogsPermission.check(
            getPermissionChecker(), serviceContext.getScopeGroupId(),
            ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY);

        return blogsEntryLocalService.addEntry(
            getUserId(), title, description, content, displayDateMonth,
            displayDateDay, displayDateYear, displayDateHour, displayDateMinute,
            allowPingbacks, allowTrackbacks, trackbacks, smallImage,
            smallImageURL, smallImageFileName, smallImageInputStream,
            serviceContext);
    }

Check out the parameters passed into the `check(...)` method. Again, the
`getPermissionChecker()` method is readily available in all `ServiceImpl`
classes. The blogs entry ID is available in the `serviceContext`, indicating
that the permission check is against the Blogs portlet. `ActionKeys.ADD_ENTRY`
is a static string used to indicate the action requiring the permission check.
Likewise, you're encouraged to use custom portlet action keys. 

<!-- We're not ready for review yet. We haven't covered how to create the helper
class, which is what the reader is expecting out of this section. Certainly I
was. We've only seen how to use a helper class that already exists. -Rich -->

Let's review what we've just covered. Implementing permission into your custom
portlet consists of four main steps: 
 
1.  Define any custom resources and actions. 

2.  Implement code to register (or add) any newly created resources, such as a
    `BlogsEntry` object. 

3.  Provide an interface for the user to configure permission. 

4.  Implement code to check permission before returning resources or showing
    custom features.  

The two major resources are portlets and entities. Liferay does most of the work
for you by providing a configuration file and a system of resources that let you
check permissions wherever you need to in your application. 

You're now equipped to implement security in your custom Liferay portlets!
