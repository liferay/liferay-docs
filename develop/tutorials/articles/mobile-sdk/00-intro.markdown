# Mobile SDK [](id=mobile)

With all the power that Liferay Portal offers, why not leverage it from your
mobile apps! Thanks to Liferay's Mobile SDK, you can do just that. The Liferay
Mobile SDK provides a way to streamline consuming Liferay core web services,
Liferay utilities, and custom portlet web services. It wraps Liferay JSON web
services, making them easy to call in native mobile apps. It takes care of
authentication, makes HTTP requests (synchronously or asynchronously), parses
JSON results, and handles server-side exceptions so you can concentrate on
*using* the services in your app. 

The Liferay Mobile SDK is compatible with Liferay Portal 6.2 and later. Liferay
provides the Liferay Android SDK and and Liferay iOS SDK 
ready for you to download and use. The official project [page](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk/overview)
gives you access to the SDK releases, provides the latest SDK news, and has 
forums for you to engage in mobile app development discussions.

The Liferay Mobile SDK plugin for Eclipse simplifies developing Android apps 
that use Liferay. You can configure the Android SDK manually to use with Android 
apps. Once configured, you can invoke Liferay services from your app. The 
Liferay Android SDK bridges your native app with Liferay services. 

And how about your custom portlet services? Do you want to leverage them too?
With Liferay's Mobile SDK Builder you can generate JAR files that make your
custom portlets accessible to your native mobile apps. How's that for delivering
the goods!
