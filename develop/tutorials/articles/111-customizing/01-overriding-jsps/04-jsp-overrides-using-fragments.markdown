# JSP Overrides Using OSGi Fragments [](id=overriding-a-modules-jsps)

You can completely override JSPs using OSGi fragments. This approach is powerful
but can make things unstable when the host module is upgraded:  

1.  By overriding an entire JSP, you might not account for new content or new 
    widgets that are essential to new host module versions. 
2.  Fragments are tied to a specific host module version. If the host module is
    upgraded, the fragment detaches from it. In this scenario, the original
    JSPs are still available and the module is functional (but lacks your JSP
    enhancements).

[Liferay's API based approaches to overriding JSPs](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/overriding-jsps#using-portals-api-to-override-a-jsp),
on the other hand, provide more stability as they let you customize specific
parts of the JSP that are safe to override. Also, the API based approaches don't
limit your override to a specific host module version. In case you're
maintaining existing JSP overrides that use OSGi fragments, however, this
tutorial explains how they work. 

An OSGi fragment that overrides a JSP requires these two things:

-  Specifies a host module's symbolic name and version in the OSGi header 
   `Fragment-Host` declaration.

-  includes the original JSP with any modifications you need to make.

For more information about fragment modules, you can refer to section 3.14 of the [OSGi Alliance's core specification document](https://www.osgi.org/developer/downloads/release-6/).

## Declaring a Fragment Host [](id=declaring-a-fragment-host)

There are two players in this game: the fragment and the host. The fragment is
a parasitic module that attaches itself to a host. That sounds harsh, so let's
compare the fragment-host relationship to the relationship between a pilot fish
and a huge, scary shark. It's symbiotic, really. Your fragment module benefits
by not doing much work (like the pilot fish who benefits from the shark's
hunting prowess). In return, the host module gets whatever benefits you've
conjured up in your fragment's JSPs (for the shark, it gets free dental
cleanings!). To the OSGi runtime, your fragment is part of the host module.

Your fragment must declare two things to the OSGi runtime regarding the host
module:

1. The Bundle Symbolic Name of the host module.

    This is the module containing the original JSP.

2. The exact version of the host module to which the fragment belongs.

Both are declared using the OSGi header `Fragment-Host`.

    Fragment-Host: com.liferay.login.web;bundle-version="[1.0.0,1.0.1)"

Supplying a specific host module version is important. If that version of the
module isn't present, your fragment won't attach itself to a host, and that's a
good thing. A new version of the host module might have changed its JSPs, so if
your now-incompatible version of the JSP is applied to the host module, you'll
break the functionality of the host. It's better to detach your fragment
and leave it lonely in the OSGi runtime than it is to break the functionality of
an entire application.

## Provide the Overridden JSP [](id=provide-the-overridden-jsp)

There are two possible naming conventions for targeting the host original JSP: 
`portal` or `original`. For example, if the original JSP is in the folder
`/META-INF/resources/login.jsp`, then the fragment bundle should contain a JSP
with the same path, using the following pattern:

    <liferay-util:include 
        page="/login.original.jsp" (or login.portal.jsp) 
        servletContext="<%= application %>" 
    />

After that, make your modifications. Just make sure you mimic the host module's
folder structure when overriding its JAR. If you're overriding Liferay's login
application's `login.jsp` for example, you'd put your own `login.jsp` in 

    my-jsp-fragment/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/login.jsp

If you need to post-process the output, you can update the pattern to include 
@product@'s buffering mechanism. Below is an example that overrides the 
original `create_account.jsp`:

    <%@ include file="/init.jsp" %>
    
    <liferay-util:buffer var="html">
        <liferay-util:include page="/create_account.portal.jsp" 
        servletContext="<%= application %>"/>
    </liferay-util:buffer>
    
    <liferay-util:buffer var="openIdFieldHtml"><aui:input name="openId" 
    type="hidden" value="<%= ParamUtil.getString(request, "openId") %>" />
    </liferay-util:buffer>
    
    <liferay-util:buffer var="userNameFieldsHtml"><liferay-ui:user-name-fields />
    </liferay-util:buffer>

    <liferay-util:buffer var="errorMessageHtml">
        <liferay-ui:error 
        exception="<%= com.liferay.portal.kernel.exception.NoSuchOrganizationException.class %>" message="no-such-registration-code" />
    </liferay-util:buffer>
    
    <liferay-util:buffer var="registrationCodeFieldHtml">
                <aui:input name="registrationCode" type="text" value="">
                        <aui:validator name="required" />
                </aui:input>
    </liferay-util:buffer>
    
    <%
        html = com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.StringUtil.replace(html, 
          openIdFieldHtml, openIdFieldHtml + errorMessageHtml);
        html = com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.StringUtil.replace(html, 
          userNameFieldsHtml, userNameFieldsHtml + registrationCodeFieldHtml);
    %>
    
    <%=html %>

**Note:** An OSGi fragment can access all of the fragment host's packages---it 
doesn't need to import them from another bundle. bnd adds external packages the
fragment uses (even ones in the fragment host) to the fragment's
`Import-Package: [package],...` OSGi manifest header. That's fine for packages
exported to the OSGi runtime. The problem is, however, when bnd tries to import
a host's internal package (a package the host doesn't export). The OSGi runtime
can't activate the fragment because the internal package remains an `Unresolved
requirement`---a fragment shouldn't import a fragment host's packages. 

If your fragment uses an internal package from the fragment host, continue using
it but explicitly exclude the package from your bundle's `Import-Package` OSGi
manifest header. This `Import-Package` header, for example, excludes packages
that match `com.liferay.portal.search.web.internal.*`. 

    Import-Package: !com.liferay.portal.search.web.internal.*,*

Now you can easily modify the JSPs of any application in Liferay.
