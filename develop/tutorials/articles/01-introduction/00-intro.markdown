# Introduction [](id=tutorials)

Welcome to Liferay's tutorials and Learning Paths! Both show you how to build 
powerful, robust apps using Liferay's tools, frameworks, and APIs. The first few 
sections here are Learning Paths. Learning Paths walk you through the 
development of a specific example application from start to finish, beginning 
with setting up your development environment and ending with a fully functional 
example application. They're called Learning Paths because they're designed to 
be followed from beginning to end and cover multiple topics along the way. 
Learning Paths are thus ideal for getting started with Liferay development. 
Currently, the following learning paths are available: 

- [Writing a Liferay MVC Application](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-liferay-mvc-application)
- [Writing a JSF Application Using Liferay Faces](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-a-jsf-application-using-liferay-faces)
- [Developing a Liferay Theme](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/developing-a-liferay-theme)
- [Writing an Android App for Your Portal](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/writing-an-android-app-for-your-portal)

The sections that follow the Learning Paths are tutorials. Rather than spanning 
the multiple topics a Learning Path requires to produce a specific example 
application, tutorials go more in depth on individual topics, and don't yield a 
complete example application. Although tutorials also contain example code, this 
code is general and is designed to give you the information you need on only the 
topics of your choosing. You can then apply this to your own custom Liferay 
applications. This makes tutorials better suited to those with some experience 
in Liferay development. The tutorials cover the following three main areas: 

- Using Liferay Development Tools
- Developing Liferay Applications
- Styling and Customizing Liferay

First, consider the tools Liferay provides to make your job easier.

#### Using Liferay Development Tools [](id=using-liferay-development-tools)

Since many developers coming to Liferay already have a set of tools they use,
these tutorials assume you're using one of three common environments: 1) An
Ant-based command-line environment that integrates with a wide variety of tools,
2) The easy-to-use Liferay IDE that minimizes your learning curve while giving
you powerful development features, and 3) Maven, a widely adopted project
management system. The Liferay Developer Network provides learning paths and
tutorials that teach you how to use these three environments.

If you don't like Eclipse (which Liferay IDE is based on) and prefer to use
NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, or something else, you certainly can. Liferay code can
be written in any way Java code is written. 

Here are some links to instructions on Liferay development tools:

[Beginning Liferay Development](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/beginning-liferay-development) 

[Developing with the Plugins SDK](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/plugins-sdk)

[Developing with Liferay IDE](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-ide)

[Developing with Maven](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/maven)

#### Developing Liferay Applications [](id=developing-liferay-applications)

As a developer wanting to run your own applications on top of Liferay Portal,
you probably want to know *what's the best and quickest way to do it?* Liferay
supports two main, standards-based technologies for incorporating your
applications into Liferay: **Portlets** and **OpenSocial gadgets**. Portlets can
be written using any of the Java web frameworks that support portlet
development, including Liferay's MVC Portlet framework and JavaServer&#8482;
Faces (JSF).

As you write apps, you'll want to leverage powerful frameworks that work 
seamlessly with Liferay and help you complete your app faster. Liferay contains
several frameworks that give you all the tools you need to perform various 
common tasks that you don't want to write yourself, such as handling permissions 
and letting users enter comments, categories, and tags. 

In addition to Liferay's frameworks, you'll want to check out the powerful
tag libraries and snazzy UI components that
[AlloyUI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/alloyui) and
[Liferay UI Taglibs](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-ui-taglibs)
provide.

#### Styling and Customizing Liferay [](id=styling-and-customizing-liferay)

What if you want to skin Liferay or customize it? Creating themes and 
customizations is easy in Liferay. 

Here are some good tutorials to start with:

[Themes and Layout Templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/themes-and-layout-templates)

[Customizing Liferay Portal](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/customizing-liferay-portal)

Now that you know what the articles here offer, it's time to discover new things 
as you develop sites in Liferay.
