# Customizing the Control Menu [](id=customizing-the-control-menu)

The Control Menu is the most visible and accessible menu in Liferay. It is
visible to the user in most places, always displaying helpful text or options
at the top of the page. For example, on your home page, the Control Menu offers
default options for accessing the Product Menu, Simulation Menu, and Add Menu.
You can think of this menu as the gateway to configuring options in Liferay.

![Figure 1: The Control Menu has three configurable areas: left, right, and middle.](../../images/control-menu-home.png)

If you navigate away from the home page, the Control Menu adapts and provides
helpful functionality for what ever option you're using. For example, if you
navigated to Site Administration &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Web Content*, you'd be
displayed a Control Menu with different functionality tailored for that option.

![Figure 2: When switching your context to web content, the Control Menu adapts to provide helpful options for that area.](../../images/control-menu-web-content.png)

The default Control Menu is made up of three categories that represent the left,
middle, and right portions of the menu. You can create navigation entries for
each category, which can provide options or further navigation for the
particular screen you're on.

**Note:** You can add the Control Menu to a custom theme by adding the following
snippet into your `portal_normal.ftl`:

    <@liferay.control_menu />

The other product navigation menus (e.g., Product Menu, Simulation Menu) are
included in this tag, so specifying the above snippet will embed all three menus
into your theme. Embedding the User Personal Bar is slightly different. Visit
the [Providing the User Personal Bar](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/providing-the-user-personal-bar)
tutorial for more information.

You can reference a sample Control Menu Entry by visiting the
[Control Menu Entry](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/control-menu-entry)
article.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create your own entries to customize the
Control Menu. Make sure to read the
[Adding Custom Panel Categories](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/customizing-the-product-menu#adding-custom-panel-categories)
before beginning this tutorial. This tutorial assumes you have knowledge on
creating a panel category. You'll begin by creating an entry for the Control
Menu.

1. Create a generic OSGi module using your favorite third party tool, or use
   [Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli). Your module
   must contain a Java class, `bnd.bnd` file, and build file (e.g.,
   `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`). You'll create your Java class next if your
   project does not already define one.

2. Create a unique package name in the module's `src` directory and create a
   new Java class in that package. To follow naming conventions, give your
   class a unique name followed by *ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry* (e.g.,
   `StagingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry`).

3. Directly above the class's declaration, insert the following annotation:

        @Component(
            immediate = true,
            property = {
                "product.navigation.control.menu.category.key=" + [Control Menu Category],
                "product.navigation.control.menu.category.order:Integer=[int]"
            },
            service = ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.class
        )

    The `product.navigation.control.menu.category.key` property specifies the
    category your entry should reside in. As mentioned previously, the default
    Control Menu provides three categories: Sites (left portion), Tools (middle
    portion), and User (right portion).

    ![Figure 3: This image shows where your entry will reside depending on the category you select.](../../images/control-menu-areas.png)

    To specify the category, reference the appropriate key in the
    [ProductNavigationControlMenuCategoryKeys](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/constants/ProductNavigationControlMenuCategoryKeys.html)
    class. For example, the following property would place your entry in the
    middle portion of the Control Menu:

        "product.navigation.control.menu.category.key=" + ProductNavigationControlMenuCategoryKeys.TOOLS

    Similar to panel categories, you'll also need to specify an integer for the
    order in which your entry will be displayed in the category. Entries are
    ordered from left to right. For example, an entry with order `1` will be
    listed to the left of an entry with order `2`. If the order is not
    specified, it's chosen at random based on which service was registered first
    in the OSGi container. Lastly, your `service` element should specify the
    `ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.class` service.

4. Implement the
   [ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.html)
   interface. You can also extend the
   [BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.html)
   or
   [BaseJSPProductNavigationControlMenuEntry](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/BaseJSPProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.html)
   abstract classes. Typically, the `BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` is
   extended for basic entries (e.g.,
   `IndexingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry`) that only display a link with
   text or a simple icon. If you'd like to provide a more complex UI, like
   buttons or a sub-menu, you can do so by overriding the `include()` and
   `includeBody()` methods. If you are going to use JSPs for generating the UI,
   you can extend `BaseJSPProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` to save time. This
   will be elaborated on more extensively in the next step.

5. Define your Control Menu entry. You'll explore two examples to discover some
   options you have available for defining your entry. First, let's take a look
   at a simple example for providing text and an icon. The
   [IndexingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.3-ga4/modules/apps/foundation/portal-search/portal-search-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/portal/search/web/internal/product/navigation/control/menu/IndexingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.java)
   extends the
   `BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` class and is used when Liferay is
   indexing. For this process, the indexing entry is displayed in the *Tools*
   (middle) area of the Control Menu with a *Refresh* icon and text stating *The
   Portal is currently indexing*. The icon is defined by calling the following
   method:

        @Override
        public String getIcon(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "reload";
        }

    By default, Lexicon icons are expected to be returned. This is because the 
    [`BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.getMarkupView` method](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/BaseProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.html#getMarkupView-javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-)
    returns `lexicon`. To view all the Lexicon icons available, see
    [https://liferay.github.io/clay/content/icons-lexicon/](https://liferay.github.io/clay/content/icons-lexicon/).
    You can also return FontAwesome icons, but you must implement the
    [ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.getMarkupView(...)](@app-ref@/web-experience/latest/javadocs/com/liferay/product/navigation/control/menu/ProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.html#getMarkupView-javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-)
    method in your class and have it return `null`. Then you can return
    FontAwesome icons for the `getIcon(...)` method. To view all the
    FontAwesome icons available, see the
    [FontAwesome 4.6.1 docs](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

    You can also provide a label for the Control Menu entry that displays when
    hovering over it with your pointer. This label is stored in the module's
    resource bundle, which you can learn more about in the
    [Internationalization](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/internationalization)
    tutorials.

        @Override
        public String getLabel(Locale locale) {
            ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundleUtil.getBundle(
                "content.Language", locale, getClass());

            return LanguageUtil.get(
                resourceBundle, "the-portal-is-currently-reindexing");
        }

    To do this, you'll need to create a `Language.properties` for your module.

    You also have the option to provide a Lexicon or CSS icon in your
    `*ControlMenuEntry`. To use a Lexicon icon, you should override the methods
    in `ProductMenuProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` like the following:

        public String getIconCssClass(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "";
        }

        public String getIcon(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "lexicon-icon";
        }

        public String getMarkupView(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "lexicon";
        }

    Likewise, you can use a CSS icon by overriding the
    `ProductMenuProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` methods like the following:

        public String getIconCssClass(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "icon-css";
        }

        public String getIcon(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "";
        }

        public String getMarkupView(HttpServletRequest request) {
            return "";
        }

    The icons used in the two examples for Lexicon and CSS icons can be found in
    the [icons-lexicon](https://liferay.github.io/clay/content/icons-lexicon/)
    and
    [icons-font-awesome](https://liferay.github.io/clay/content/icons-font-awesome/)
    components, respectively.

    The [ProductMenuProductNavigationControlMenuEntry](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/7.0.3-ga4/modules/apps/web-experience/product-navigation/product-navigation-product-menu-web/src/main/java/com/liferay/product/navigation/product/menu/web/internal/product/navigation/control/menu/ProductMenuProductNavigationControlMenuEntry.java)
    is a more advanced example. This entry displays in the *Sites* (left) area
    of the Control Menu, but unlike the previous example, it extends the
    `BaseJSPProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` class. This provides several more
    methods that lets you use JSPs to define your entry's UI. There are two
    methods to pay special attention to:
 
        @Override
        public String getBodyJspPath() {
            return "/portlet/control_menu/product_menu_control_menu_entry_body.jsp";
        }

        @Override
        public String getIconJspPath() {
            return "/portlet/control_menu/product_menu_control_menu_entry_icon.jsp";
        }

    The `getIconJspPath()` method provides the Product Menu icon
    (![Menu Closed](../../images/icon-menu.png) &rarr; ![Menu Open](../../images/icon-menu-open.png))
    and the `getBodyJspPath()` method adds the UI body for the entry outside of
    the Control Menu. The latter method must be used when providing a UI outside
    the Control Menu. You can easily test this when you open and close the
    Product Menu on the home page.

    <!-- Explain two JSPs above further! -Cody -->

    Lastly, if you're planning on providing functionality that will stay
    exclusively inside the Control Menu, the
    `StagingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` class calls its JSP like this:

        @Override
        public String getIconJspPath() {
            return "/control_menu/entry.jsp";
        }

    <!-- Elaborate more on JSP! -Cody -->

    In particular, the `entry.jsp` is returned, which embeds the Staging Bar
    portlet into the Control Menu.

    You will also need to specify the servlet context from where you are loading
    the JSP files. If this is inside an OSGi module, make sure your `bnd.bnd`
    file has defined a web context path:

        Bundle-SymbolicName: com.sample.my.module.web
        Web-ContextPath: /my-module-web

    And then reference the Servlet context using the symbolic name of your
    module like this:

        @Override
        @Reference(
            target = "(osgi.web.symbolicname=com.sample.my.module.web)",
            unbind = "-"
        )
        public void setServletContext(ServletContext servletContext) {
            super.setServletContext(servletContext);
        }

6. Define when to display your new entry in the Control Menu. As you've learned
   already, the Control Panel displays different entries depending on the page
   you've navigated to. You can specify when your entry should display using the
   `isShow(HttpServletRequest)` method.

    For example, the `IndexingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` class queries
    the number of indexing jobs when calling `isShow`. If the query count is
    *0*, then the indexing entry is not displayed in the Control Menu:

        @Override
        public boolean isShow(HttpServletRequest request) throws PortalException {
            int count = _indexWriterHelper.getReindexTaskCount(
                CompanyConstants.SYSTEM, false);

            if (count == 0) {
                return false;
            }

            return super.isShow(request);
        }

    The `StagingProductNavigationControlMenuEntry` class is selective over which
    pages to display for. The staging entry is configured to never display if
    the page is an administration page (e.g., *Site Administration*, *My
    Account*, etc.):

        @Override
        public boolean isShow(HttpServletRequest request) throws PortalException {
            ThemeDisplay themeDisplay = (ThemeDisplay)request.getAttribute(
                WebKeys.THEME_DISPLAY);

            Layout layout = themeDisplay.getLayout();

            // This controls if the page is an Administration Page

            if (layout.isTypeControlPanel()) {
                return false;
            }

            // This controls if Staging is enabled

            if (!themeDisplay.isShowStagingIcon()) {
                return false;
            }

            return true;
        }

7. Define the dependencies for your Control Menu Entry. This should be completed
   in your build file (e.g., `build.grade` or `pom.xml`). For example, some
   popular dependencies (in Gradle format) are defined below:

        dependencies {
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.product.navigation.control.menu.api", version: "[VERSION]"
            compile group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.product.navigation.taglib", version: "[VERSION]"
            compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.portal.kernel", version: "[VERSION]"
            compileOnly group: "javax.servlet", name: "javax.servlet-api", version: "[VERSION]"
            compile group: "javax.servlet.jsp", name: "javax.servlet.jsp-api", version: "[VERSION]"
            compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.service.component.annotations", version: "[VERSION]"
        }

    Your project may require more dependencies, depending on your module's
    functionality.

Excellent! You've created your entry in one of the three default panel
categories in the Control Menu. You learned a basic way and an advanced way of
providing that entry, and learned how to apply both.
