# Service Trackers [](id=service-trackers)

In an OSGi runtime ecosystem, you must consider how your modules can rely on
services in other modules for functionality. It's possible for service
implementations to be swapped out or removed entirely, and your module must not
just survive but thrive in this environment. 

If you 
[call services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/invoking-local-services)
from `@Component` classes, it's easy: you just use another 
[Declarative Services (DS)](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.component.html)
annotation, `@Reference`, to get a service reference. The component activates
when the referenced service is available. 

+$$$

**Note:** The `@Reference` annotation can only be used in a class that is 
annotated with `@Component`. That is, only a Declarative Services component can
use `@Reference` to bind to an OSGi service. 

$$$

If you can use DS and leverage the `@Component` and `@Reference` annotations,
you should. DS handles much of the complexity of handling service dynamism for
you transparently.

If you can't use DS to create a Component, keep reading to learn how to
implement a Service Tracker to look up services in the service registry.

**Note:** When using Service Trackers in your WAR-style project, you must
configure the required `org.osgi.core` dependency carefully in your build file
(e.g., `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, etc.) to avoid errors. Since it's included in
@product@ by default, it must be configured as `provided`. See the
[Third Party Packages Portal Exports](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/third-party-packages-portal-exports)
tutorial for more information.

What scenarios might require using a service tracker? Keep in mind we're
focusing on scenarios where DS *can't* be used. This typically involves a
non-native (to OSGi) Dependency Injection framework.

    and made into an OSGi module

**Note:**  The static utility classes (e.g., `UserLocalServiceUtil`) that were 
useful in Liferay Portal 6.2 (and earlier) exist for compatibility but should
not be called, if possible.  Static utility classes cannot account for the OSGi
runtime's dynamic environment. If you use a static class, you might attempt
calling a stopped service or one that hasn't been deployed or started. This
could cause unrecoverable runtime errors. Service Trackers, however, help you
make OSGi-friendly service calls.

$$$

Your non-OSGi application can access any service registered in the OSGi runtime
using a Service Tracker, including your own 
[Service Builder services](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/what-is-service-builder) 
and the services published by Liferay's modules (like the popular
`UserLocalService`).

## Using Service Tracker Factory [](id=using-service-tracker-factory)

`com.liferay.osgi.util.ServiceTrackerFactory` is a convinient class for getting the service
tracker of a component. It can return a service tracker that is already opened and ready to use.

Here is a Groovy script example for retrieving the `JournalConverter`
service to parse a Web Content article (ID `91782`) into the `Fields` class, a nested map
easier to use than XPath:

    import com.liferay.journal.service.JournalArticleLocalServiceUtil
    import com.liferay.journal.model.JournalArticle
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.xml.Document
    import com.liferay.journal.util.JournalConverter
    import com.liferay.dynamic.data.mapping.model.DDMStructure
    import com.liferay.dynamic.data.mapping.storage.Fields
    import com.liferay.osgi.util.ServiceTrackerFactory
    import org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker

    JournalArticle ja = JournalArticleLocalServiceUtil.getArticle(91782)
    DDMStructure struct = ja.getDDMStructure()
    Document doc = ja.getDocument()
    ServiceTracker jc = ServiceTrackerFactory.open(JournalConverter.class)
    Fields fields = jc.getService().getDDMFields(struct, doc)
    jc.close()

## Implementing a Service Tracker [](id=implementing-a-service-tracker)

Service Trackers don't give you the luxury of managing your service dependencies
with DS, but you can call services from the service registry.

You can implement a service tracker in two ways: 1) In the code where you need
it, or 2) In a class that extends `org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker`. 

To create it directly, do this: 

    import org.osgi.framework.Bundle;
    import org.osgi.framework.FrameworkUtil;
    import org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker;

    Bundle bundle = FrameworkUtil.getBundle(this.getClass());
    BundleContext bundleContext = bundle.getBundleContext();
    ServiceTracker<SomeService, SomeService> serviceTracker =
        new ServiceTracker(bundleContext, SomeService.class, null);
    serviceTracker.open();
    SomeService someService = serviceTracker.waitForService(500);

A better way is to create a class that extends
`org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker`, because this simplifies your code. 

1.  Create a class like this one that extends `ServiceTracker`: 

        public class SomeServiceTracker
            extends ServiceTracker<SomeService, SomeService> {

            public SomeServiceTracker(Object host) {
                super(
                    FrameworkUtil.getBundle(host.getClass()).getBundleContext(),
                    SomeService.class, null);
            }
        }

2.  From the initialization part of your logic that uses the service, call your
    service tracker constructor. The `Object host` parameter obtains your own
    bundle context and must be an object from your own bundle in order to give
    accurate results. 

        ServiceTracker<SomeService, SomeService> someServiceTracker =
            new SomeServiceTracker(this);

3.  When you want to use the service tracker, open it, typically as early as
    you can. 

        someServiceTracker.open();

4.  Before attempting to use a service, use the Service Tracker to interrogate
    the service's state. In your program logic, for example, check whether the
    service is `null` before using it:

        SomeService someService = someServiceTracker.getService();

        if (someService == null) {
            _log.warn("The required service 'SomeService' is not available.");
        }
        else {
            someService.doSomethingCool();
        }

    Service Trackers have several other utility functions for introspecting tracked
    services.

5.  Later when your application is being destroyed or undeployed, close the
    service tracker. 

        someServiceTracker.close();

Service Trackers make it possible to call OSGi services from outside the OSGi
runtime. 

## Implementing a Callback Handler for Services [](id=implementing-a-callback-handler-for-services)

If there's a strong possibility the service might not be available or if you
need to track multiple services, the Service Tracker API provides a callback
mechanism that operates on service *events*. To use this, override
`ServiceTracker`'s `addingService` and `removedService` methods. Their
`ServiceReference` parameter references an active service object. 

Here's an example `ServiceTracker` implementation from the
[OSGi Alliance's OSGi Core Release 7 specification](https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/util.tracker.html#d0e51991):

    new ServiceTracker<HttpService, MyServlet>(context, HttpService.class, null) {

        public MyServlet addingService(ServiceReference<HttpService> reference) {
            HttpService httpService = context.getService(reference);
            MyServlet myServlet = new MyServlet(httpService);
            return myServlet;
        }

        public void removedService(
            ServiceReference<HttpService> reference, MyServlet myServlet) {
            myServlet.close();
            context.ungetService(reference);
        }
    }

When the `HttpService` is added to the OSGi registry, this `ServiceTracker`
creates a new wrapper class, `MyServlet`, which uses the newly added service.
When the service is removed from the registry, the `removedService` method
cleans up related resources. 

As an alternative to directly overloading `ServiceTracker` methods, create a
`org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTrackerCustomizer`: 

    class MyServiceTrackerCustomizer 
        implements ServiceTrackerCustomizer<SomeService, MyWrapper> {
        
        private final BundleContext bundleContext;
        
        MyServiceTrackerCustomizer(BundleContext bundleContext) {
            this.bundleContext = bundleContext;
        }
        
        @Override
        public MyWrapper addedService(
            ServiceReference<SomeService> serviceReference) {
            
            // Determine if the service is one that's interesting to you.
            // The return type of this method is the `tracked` type. Its type 
            // is what is returned from `getService*` methods; useful for wrapping 
            // the service with your own type (e.g., MyWrapper).
            if (isInteresting(serviceReference)) {
                MyWrapper myWrapper = new MyWrapper(
                    serviceReference, bundleContext.getService());
                
                // trigger the logic that requires the available service(s)
                triggerServiceAddedLogic(myWrapper);
                
                return myWrapper;
            }
            
            // If the return is null, the tracker is effectively ignoring any further
            // events for the service reference
            return null;
        }

        @Override
        public void modifiedService(
            ServiceReference<SomeService> serviceReference, MyWrapper myWrapper) {
            // handle the modified service
        }

        @Override
        public void removedService(
            ServiceReference<SomeService> serviceReference, MyWrapper myWrapper) {

            // finally, trigger logic when the service is going away
            triggerServiceRemovedLogic(myWrapper);
    	}

    }

Register the `ServiceTrackerCustomizer` by passing it as the `ServiceTracker`
constructor's third parameter.

    ServiceTrackerCustomizer<SomeService, MyWrapper> serviceTrackerCustomizer =
        new MyServiceTrackerCustomizer();

    ServiceTracker<SomeService, MyWrapper> serviceTracker = 
        new ServiceTracker<>(
        	bundleContext, SomeService.class, serviceTrackerCustomizer);

There's a little boilerplate code you need to produce, but now you can look up
services in the service registry, even if your plugins can't take advantage of
the Declarative Services component model.
