# Liferay Workspace

A *Liferay Workspace* is a generated environment that is built to hold and
manage your Liferay projects. This workspace is intended to aid in the
management of Liferay projects by providing various Gradle build scripts and
configured properties. This is the official way to create Liferay 7.0 modules
using Gradle.
