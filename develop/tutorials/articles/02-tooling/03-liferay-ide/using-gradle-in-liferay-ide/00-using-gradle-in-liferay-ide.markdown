# Using Gradle in Liferay IDE

[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) is an open source build automation system. [Buildship](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/neon) is a collection of Eclipse plugin-ins that provide support for building software using Gradle and it is going to be a part of Neon. In the meantime, we’ve bundled it in Liferay IDE 3.0.0 and users can use gradle easily in any version of eclipse with Liferay IDE 3.0.0 intsalled.
