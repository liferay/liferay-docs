# Working Smarter with Liferay Social Office  [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-working-smarter-with-liferay-social-office)

Liferay Social Office is Liferay's social collaboration product for the
enterprise. Previously released as a separate product that was based on Liferay
Portal, it's now available as an application that can be installed on Liferay.
We are excited to bring both Social Office and this guide to you, in the hope
that you'll be able to use each to enable your teams to work together more
efficiently. 

Some time ago, we at Liferay were brainstorming some common use cases which
Liferay Portal does a good job solving. One of these is team-based
collaboration. Many of our customers have used Liferay Portal both inside their
enterprises and outside on the Internet to provide a better way of sharing
documents and data with the people they work with every day. Liferay Portal
provides a very flexible solution which allows you not only to do this, but
much, much more. Because Liferay Portal is so flexible, the path from the
initial install to a robust web site that could be used for collaboration was
not always straightforward to the new user. The Social Office plugin is designed
to allow business users to set up and use Liferay Portal for collaboration right
away.

This was not the only reason for Social Office. Internally, we realized that we
needed a product like this ourselves. We knew that, in Liferay Portal, we
already had all the features in place to make it possible. We just needed to
assemble and extend them in a way that optimally supported the scenario of
social collaboration. We also wanted to make setup as easy as possible for new
users. In this way, Social Office was born. We created the product to provide
a simple, out of the box solution for team collaboration. Social Office provides
you with a fantastic array of features that you don't need to spend a lot of
time configuring. In fact, you can have a full production environment set up in
less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee.

Social Office is a dynamic team collaboration solution for the enterprise that's
designed to streamline communication, save time, and raise productivity.
Organizations and groups can use Social Office to share resources, collaborate
on projects, and raise the visibility of important activity. Social Office
features a robust suite of integrated, easy-to-use web applications. It's ready
to use right out of the box. Once installed, a quick setup wizard will help you
set up a team collaboration site so you can begin working immediately.

Since Social Office is provided as a plugin for Liferay Portal, it inherits all
the benefits of a mature, stable solution which has been in the marketplace for
some time. You can start using Social Office's straightforward, out-of-the box
collaborative features right away. You're also free to utilize any of the more
advanced features of Liferay Portal at any time. 

This guide is for those who are setting up and administering an instance of
Liferay Portal using Social Office. From installing Social Office to introducing
you to its entire feature set, we'll discuss all of the things you can do with
Social Office to help your team. We hope you'll use it as a tool to get Social
Office up, running, and integrated into your enterprise. You can find much more

## Introduction  [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-introduction)

"Help!"

This has been the cry of information workers everywhere who have tried to manage
complex projects through email and shared folders. You've probably had a similar
experience: you're collaborating on a document with a team of people and are
emailing it back and forth. Person A creates the initial document and Person
B replies with some edits. Person C replies with additional edits at the same
time Person A replies with the corrections from Person B. Person D takes this
and rewrites a whole section of the document while Person B and C respond to
Person A's update. Pretty soon, it becomes very difficult to determine which
document is the latest document.

The same scenario plays itself out when working in shared folders. Person
A creates a document and puts it in a network share. Person B edits the document
and saves it under a different file name. Person C edits it and re-saves the
original. Person A tries to reconcile the two, while Person D opens Person B's
document and saves yet another version. Before you know it, you have the same
problem you had with email: you can't tell which document is the latest
document. Additionally, you have a worse problem: you don't have a clear history
of how the document got to where it is in the first place. 

"Help!"

The Social Office plugin for Liferay Portal is designed to answer this call for
help by meeting the needs of teams who work together on projects. It's easy to
set up and makes it easier to facilitate collaboration for large and small
businesses alike. With Liferay Social Office, you'll have the system and your
workgroups up and running in no time, with all the tools necessary for them to
work more efficiently and more easily than before.

Social Office gives you the social collaboration features you need to do virtual
teamwork. You can coordinate calendars and schedules, write shared blog entries,
work together on documents, discuss issues in forums, document everything in
a wiki, and more. The underlying theme is that all discussion and collaboration
is kept with the asset. What does this mean? It means that the asset, whether
that be a document, a thread, a blog entry, or a wiki article is the star around
which all of the discussion and collaboration orbits. 

Trying to collaborate on assets through email or server shares works up to
a certain point--but then it fails because it's a backwards way of doing the
work. The asset in that scenario becomes secondary, and the "wrapper"--email or
the share--becomes the primary target of the work. So instead of concentrating
on the asset which the team is trying to produce, the focus turns to the
wrapper. In the case of a shared folder, you might manually rename documents
according to a numbering scheme so everyone can tell which is the latest--that
is, until someone forgets to do so, or until someone accidentally overwrites the
latest document. In the case of email, users try to navigate huge threads while
passing an asset back and forth--until someone forgets to "reply all" or until
someone starts a new thread (and maybe forgets to put the whole list on the
thread). Working in the mediums of shared folders or email puts the focus on
working with the wrapper, not the asset. And so the asset gets lost because
they're forced to focus on the wrapper instead of the asset. With Social Office,
you'll be free to concentrate on the assets--the system gets out of your way so
that it's a simple matter for your team to work together. 

## Installing Social Office [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-installing-social-office)

Social Office 2.0 is available as an application that can be installed on
Liferay Portal CE 6.1 GA2 or EE 6.1 GA2. Prior to version 2.0, Social Office was
provided as an standalone product that was essentially a customized version of
Liferay Portal. Liferay applications, or apps, are packages of Liferay plugins
that are grouped together with descriptions, version information, and other
metadata. You can identify downloaded Liferay apps by their `.lpkg` file
extensions. Individual Liferay plugins have the standard `.war` file extensions.

### Pre-installation Configuration [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-pre-installation-configuration)

Out of the box, Social Office works with Liferay's default portal properties.
However, if certain properties have been modified by a portal administrator
prior to your Social Office installation, they might prevent Social Office from
working properly. Before installing Social Office, please check your Liferay
instance's `portal-ext.properties` file for the following and make sure that the
following properties are set properly.

After installing Social Office and assigning the Social Office roles to a user,
the user should have a private Dashboard page and a public Profile page. The
following properties ensure that users' Dashboard and Profile pages are created
once you assign them to Social Office User Role *or* after assigning them as a
Social Office User in the (EE-only) SO Configurations portlet:

    layout.user.private.layouts.enabled=true
    layout.user.private.layouts.auto.create=true
    layout.user.public.layouts.enabled=true
    layout.user.public.layouts.auto.create=true

You may set the following properties to either `true` or `false`. `true` means
that you also have to assign the Power User role to a user in order for the user
to maintain Dashboard and Profile pages:

    layout.user.private.layouts.power.user.required=
    layout.user.public.layouts.power.user.required=

The following properties cause complications to the Social Office Dashboard and
Profile creation if the properties are set to anything else. Make sure you leave
these blank if you intend to use Social Office:

    default.user.private.layouts.lar
    default.user.public.layouts.lar

### Social Office Installation Methods [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-social-office-installation-methods)

There are two ways to install Social Office: you can download and
install Social Office directly from your Liferay instance's Control Panel
Marketplace interface or you can deploy the `.lpkg` file manually. The easiest
way to install Social Office is via your Liferay instance's Control Panel
Marketplace interface. If you opt for this installation method, you won't need
to copy a single file to your application server's deploy folder; Liferay
handles the installation for you.

To install Social Office via the Control Panel, navigate to the Control Panel
and click on *Marketplace* &rarr; *Purchased*. If you've already purchased
Social Office, you'll see Social Office listed in your purchased apps.
Otherwise, you'll have to browse Liferay Marketplace, find Social Office, and
purchase it before you can continue. For Social Office CE, click *Download* to
download the app. Once the app is downloaded, click on *Install* to start
installing Social Office. For Social Office EE, you need to register your
license before installing Social Office. See the *Installing Social Office EE*
section for details. After installing Social Office via the Control Panel, you
should notice that the *Installed* button has changed to *Uninstall*. Another
benefit of installing Social Office via your Liferay instance's Control Panel
Marketplace interface is easy access to updates. Whenever an update is
available, you can navigate to the Control Panel, click on *Marketplace* &rarr;
*Purchased*, and click on the *Update* button to update Social Office.

To install Social Office manually, you need to download the Social Office
`.lpkg` file from [Liferay Marketplace](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace).
Once you have it, you just need to deploy the Social Office `.lpkg` file to your
Liferay installation. If you're installing Social Office CE, you can install it
just like any other app from Liferay Marketplace: copy the Social Office `.lpkg`
file to your Liferay instance's deploy folder. If you're installing Social
Office EE, you should register the license order ID that you received with your
purchase before deploying the Social Office `.lpkg` file.

### Installing Social Office EE [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-installing-social-office-ee)

To find Social Office EE on Liferay Marketplace, click on the *EE Marketplace*
link and look for the Social Office EE app. Once you've found it, click on it to
view detailed information about the app. If you'd like to install Social Office
EE, you can either purchase the app or you can obtain a free 30-day trial.

![Figure 1.1: If you'd like to try out Social Office EE, click on the *30-Day Trial* button. If you'd like to purchase Social Office EE, click on the *Order* button.](../../images/so-ee-order-trial.png)

Whichever option you choose, you'll be prompted to select a purchase type. If
you'd like to obtain the free 30-day trial, you'll need to agree to the End User
License Agreement and Terms of Service before you can click *Free* to obtain the
trial license.

![Figure 1.2: As with other apps on Liferay Marketplace, you can purchase Social Office EE for your personal liferay.com account or for your company.](../../images/so-ee-order-type.png)

If you'd like to place an order to purchase Social Office EE, click *Next* after
selecting a purchase type. Then you'll need to choose a license type, provide
your name, address, and contact information, and agree to the terms of use.
Once you click *Order*, a Liferay sales representative will contact you to
fulfill your order.

![Figure 1.3: To deploy your Social Office EE license, enter your order id license into the field provided, click *Query*, and select *Social Office EE*.](../../images/so-ee-order-id-license.png)

Once you've obtained a Social Office EE license (trial or otherwise), you should
deploy the license to your Liferay instance. To do so, first click on *License
Manager* at the bottom of the Server Administration section of the Control
Panel. Then enter your order id into the field provided, click *Query*, and
select *Social Office EE*. Now you're able to install Social Office EE! Note: If
you already downloaded Social Office EE and attempted to install it before
deploying your order id license, you'll need to restart your Liferay server
after deploying the license in order for Social Office EE to deploy.

### Completing Your Installation [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-completing-your-installation)

After deploying Social Office, check your server's console log. There should not
be any console errors during installation. If you encounter any console errors,
please refer to the Validating a Social Office Installation section.

We recommend that you restart your application server after Social Office has
been deployed. Restarting may not be necessary in all cases but it can help you
avoid potential caching problems. In some cases, for example, sending and
accepting connection invitations among Social Office users might not work
without a server restart. For additional information, see the section below on
installation peculiarities for specific application servers. If you want to
avoid restarting, you should at least re-index Liferay's search indexes and
database cache. These options are available from the Server Administration
section of Liferay's Control Panel.

---

![Figure 1.4: Tip](../../images/tip.png) **Warning:** When you start Liferay for
the first time, you're presented with a setup wizard. The configuration you make
in the setup wizard is saved in a `portal-setup-wizard.properties` file in your
Liferay Home directory. However, if you specify a different Liferay Home
directory than the default in the setup wizard, the
`portal-setup-wizard.properties` file that's saved there will not be read upon
restarting your server. To have Liferay read your
`portal-setup-wizard.properties` file, create a `portal-ext.properties` file in
your new Liferay Home directory and add the following line to it, where
`${liferay.home}` is the new Liferay Home directory that you chose:

    include-and-override=${liferay.home}/portal-setup-wizard.properties

Without this workaround, Liferay will not read the
`portal-setup-wizard.properties` file with your saved configuration when you
restart your server and you'll see the setup wizard again. Furthermore, Social
Office will not be redeployed and won't be functional. This means that the
Dashboard button on the Dockbar won't show up. If you manually navigate to the
dashboard URL, you see the pages but they'll be unthemed and the portlets will
be greyed out with a message stating that they've been undeployed. 

---

### Installation Peculiarities of Specific App Servers  [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-installation-peculiarities-for-specific-apps-servers)

After installing Social Office on Glassfish, you need to restart the server
before Social Office will be fully deployed. If you don't restart, Glassfish
doesn't recognize the so-hook and the hook won't be available. Once you've
restarted the server, the so-hook deployment completes as expected.

For JBoss, you have to restart the server in order to see the Dashboard link. If
you don't restart the server, the Dashboard link won't appear although you can
find other content added by Social Office if you use the *Go to* &rarr; *My
Public/My Private Pages* menu. To fix this issue, simply restart your server.

<!-- Commenting this out now (Nov. 5, 2013) since SO 2.1 EE has been released
but SO 2.1 CE has not. The Social Office welcome theme is a CE-only feature.

### Managing the Social Office Welcome Theme [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-managing-the-social-office-welcome-theme)

The Social Office welcome theme is a CE-only feature. The welcome theme and
resource importer are included in the CE Social Office 2.0 package available
from Marketplace. The Social Office welcome theme provides a clean login screen
for Social Office when Social Office 2.0 is installed on a fresh portal
instance.

![Figure 1.5: The Social Office 2.0 welcome theme provides a clean and attractive login screen.](../../images/so-welcome-theme1.png)

A fresh portal instance is an installation of Liferay Portal whose guest site
(default liferay.com site) has not yet been modified. If the guest site has not
been modified, the default theme of the guest site is replaced by the Social
Office welcome theme. The Social Office welcome theme requires the so-hook and
the resource-importer, which is why the resource-importer is also included in
the Social Office package. 

Note that the Social Office welcome theme is not intended for customization.
It's simply intended to provide a simple login screen. If you try to customize a
page it's been applied to, you'll find that it hides the edit controls from
administrators. If you'd like to customize your portal's login page, you should
first remove the Social Office welcome theme. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Undeploy the Social Office welcome theme (so-welcome-theme).
2. Navigate to the Control Panel, click on *Sites*, and select *Actions* &rarr;
   *Edit Settings* on the guest site.
3. Set the Application Adapter field to *None*.

![Figure 1.6: Editing the default site's settings](../../images/so-welcome-theme2.png)

4. Set the theme of the site back to the classic theme or to your theme of
   choice.

![Figure 1.7: Editing the default site's
settings](../../images/so-welcome-theme3.png)

If you'd like to install the SO welcome theme when the guest site has already
been modified, you can follow these instructions:

First, you have to revert the guest site back to its original state when you
first installed Liferay Portal. This means that the guest site should only
contain one page and the page should only have the Sign In portlet and the Hello
World portlet. For Liferay Portal 6.1.1, a regular portal welcome theme is
deployed by default. That means that you'll need to take the following steps: 

1. Undeploy the portal welcome theme.
2. Delete all other pages.
3. Make sure the first page of the guest site only has the Sign In and Hello
   World portlets. 
4. Deploy the Social Office welcome theme (so-welcome-theme).

This way, the Social Office welcome theme will be applied to the portal home
page.

---

![Figure 1.8: Tip](../../images/tip.png) **Warning:** Installing the Social
Office welcome theme overwrites any pages and customizations that have already
been made to the guest site.

---

-->

Next, let's discuss how to validate that Social Office has been successfully
installed or uninstalled.

### Validating a Social Office Installation [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-validating-a-social-office-installation)

The Social Office `.lpkg` file is hot-deployable and includes the following
Liferay plugins. After installing (or uninstalling) Social Office, you should
confirm that these plugins have been successfully deployed (or removed). Your
server's console log should indicate whether or each plugin has been
successfully deployed. The plugins listed in italics belong only to either the
CE or EE versions of Social Office.

**CE Plugins:**

- chat-portlet
- contacts-portlet
- deploy-listener-hook
- events-display-portlet
- microblogs-portlet
- portal-compat-hook
- private-messaging-portlet
- *resource-importer-web*
- so-hook
- so-portlet
- so-theme
- *so-welcome-theme*
- tasks-portlet
- wysiwyg-portlet

**EE Plugins:**

- chat-portlet
- contacts-portlet
- deploy-listener-portlet
- *documentum-hook*
- events-display-portlet
- microblogs-portlet
- portal-compat-hook
- private-messaging-portlet
- *sharepoint-hook*
- *so-configurations*
- so-hook
- so-portlet
- so-theme
- tasks-portlet
- wysiwyg-portlet

If all the Social Office plugins have been successfully deployed, check that
you can access the following items in your portal, either in the Control Panel
or on a default Social Office site:

**Role**:

- Social Office User

**Site Templates**:

- Default Social Office Site
- Social Office User Home (Dashboard)
- Social Office User Profile

**Portlets**:

- Chat
- Contacts
- Events Display
- Microblogs
- Private Messaging
- Social Office Configurations (EE-only)
- Social Office Portlet
- Tasks
- Wysiwyg

**Hooks**:

- Deploy Listener
- Documentum Hook (EE-only)
- Portal Compat Hook
- Sharepoint Hook (EE-only)
- Social Office Hook

**Themes**:

- Social Office theme
- Social Office Welcome theme (CE-only)

In case you're uninstalling Social Office, make sure that the above components
are no longer available. Uninstalling Social Office from Liferay's Control Panel
Marketplace interface (recommended) uninstalls each Social Office plugin.

To actually start using Social Office after it's been installed, you need to
grant the Social Office User role to one or more users. If you're using Social
Office EE, you can access the Social Office Configurations portlet which
provides a shortcut for this process. Please refer to the *Using Social Office*
section for more details about the Social Office User role and the features
provided by Social Office.

### What to do if Your Installation is Unsuccessful [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-what-to-do-if-your-installation-is-unsuccessful)

If your Social Office Installation was unsuccessful, please make sure that you
haven't made one of the following installation mistakes:

- Your Liferay database must use character set UTF-8 in order for Social Office
  to work.
- If you have the *plugin-deployment-1* patch installed, you need to install the
  following patches on your Liferay Portal instance:
    - Core-4 or above
    - hotfix-55
    - hotfix-446
- A previously failed installation of Social Office can produce a duplicate
  entry exception and cause the installation to fail.
    - In this case, it's best to uninstall Social Office through Marketplace
      since this operation performs data clean up. 
    - If uninstalling through Marketplace is not an option, you can delete the
      following components manually through the Control Panel and attempt the
      installation again.
        - Social Office User Role
        - Default Social Office Site Template
        - Social Office User Home Template
        - Social Office User Profile Template 

If the tips above do not solve your installation problem, you can seek further
assistance through the [Social Office Forum](http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/1670998) or from [Liferay Support](http://www.liferay.com/group/customer/home).

### Uninstalling Social Office [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-uninstalling-social-office)

If you'd like to completely uninstall Social Office, you can navigate to the
*Marketplace* &rarr; *Purchased* page of the Control Panel and click on
*Uninstall*. However, after you've uninstalled Social Office from Marketplace,
you need to manually revert the friendly URL of the Welcome page. 

![Figure 1.9: After uninstalling Social Office from Marketplace, you need to manually revert the friendly URL of the Welcome page.](../../images/site_pages_welcome_sologin.png)

Also, you need to set the application adapter for the guest site to *none*
instead of *so-hook*. You can access this option from the Site Settings page of
the Control Panel.

If you don't manually revert the friendly URL of the Welcome page and the
application adapter of the guest site, the portal will look for the `/so/login`
page which no longer exists since the hook is gone. This will produce a number
of errors in the log and once you log out, you won't be able to log in again.

Uninstalling Social Office reverts users' Profile and Dashboard pages to the
default Liferay public and private pages and reverts Social Office sites to
non-Social Office sites. However, no data will be deleted. Uninstalling only
uninstalls the plugins included in Social Office, the Social Office role, and
the site templates.

Next, let's discuss how Social Office can facilitate team collaboration.

## Using Social Office [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-using-social-office)

Liferay Portal is a fully featured web portal, containing an industry-leading
suite of built-in applications and tools. It's highly customizable and
businesses use it to run major web sites all over the world. We've optimized
Liferay Portal for creating state-of-the art, robust web sites that serve
millions of users every day. Social Office adds functionality for a specific
purpose: collaboration. We've designed it for work groups needing to collaborate
on documents and data in the office. The additional tools and defaults were
carefully chosen to provide users working within a group the ability to easily
communicate, collaborate, and coordinate their tasks.

Social Office adds extra collaborative tools to Liferay and allows you to
quickly set up sites designed to facilitate collaboration. Each site is designed
to provide a single group or team with a virtual shared workspace. Members of
your organization who belong to multiple groups or teams in your organization
can belong to multiple Social Office sites on the portal. Social Office also
provides each user with customized sets of public and private pages for their
personal sites. These personal sites serve as virtual individual workspaces. The
applications they include help users manage their tasks, keep informed about
each other's activities, and communicate with each other.

Whether you're creating a public web site and need the full features of an
unparalleled, industry-leading engine or you're creating a small corporate
Intranet, Liferay Portal is the ideal solution for you. You should consider
installing the Social Office plugin if you'd like your site to facilitate
communication between people within specific groups and accomplish tasks using
shared virtual workspaces with minimal set up and administration.

The Social Office theme is used to style Social Office pages, including the
private pages of users' personal sites, their public pages, and the pages of
Social Office sites. The Social Office theme is mobile-responsive so users using
smartphones or tablets can easily use the site. The Social Office theme
adds a convenient button to the top-right corners of Social Office pages. This
button allows you to expand the portlets on the page to fit the size of your
browser window. You can click the button again to return the portlets to their
default size. In addition to the standard Social Office theme, there's also the
Social Office's welcome theme that's used to style the Social Office welcome
page (CE-only).

### Using the Social Office User Role, the User Bar, and Personal Sites [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-using-the-social-office-user-role-and-personal-sites)

Social Office adds a special role to Liferay Portal: Social Office User.
Assigning users to the Social Office User role provides them with personal sites
pre-built with pages and applications designed to help them manage their work,
share information, and communicate with each other. Social Office users also
receive a user bar that appears at the top of all portal pages when they're
logged in. Assign yourself to the Social Office User role to see how it works.
Once your user account has been granted the Social Office User role, the user
bar appears above the Dockbar. The user bar contains links to all the private
pages of the user's personal site, including a link to the *Dashboard*, the
private home page of a Social Office user's personal site. Once you've been
assigned to the Social Office User role and you see the user bar, you can
explore the extra features added to Liferay by Social Office.

If all your portal users will be using Social Office, you should add this role
to your portal's default user associations. Use the *Go to* menu of the Dockbar
to navigate to the Control Panel. Under the Portal heading, click on *Portal
Settings*. Then click on *Users* from the right-hand navigation menu. Finally,
open the *Default User Associations* tab and add the role *Social Office User*.
Now, newly created users will be assigned to the Social Office User role. If
you've been using Liferay but have just installed Social Office, you can check
the *Apply to Existing Users* box to grant the Social Office User role to
previously created users. These users will receive the role the next time they
log in to the portal.

![Figure 1.x: Social Office users receive a user bar that's accessible from all portal pages. The user bar appears above the Dockbar and allows for easy portal navigation, especially to the private pages of users' personal sites.](../../images/user-bar-dockbar.png)

The default personal pages provided by the Social Office user role include the
private Dashboard page and the public Profile page. When a user who has been
assigned to the Social Office User role logs in, the user bar appears and
several changes are made to the Dockbar. The *Dashboard* link appears as the
left-most item of the user bar and links to the other private pages of the
user's personal site appear next. You can click on these links from anywhere in
the portal to access your virtual private workspace. Also, the *Go to* menu is
moved from the Dockbar to the user bar. Instead of simply allowing the user to
navigate to one of the sites he or she belongs to, the *Go to* menu provides
access to the Sites portlet. This means that Social Office users can not only
use the *Go to* menu to navigate to sites they belong to but they can also
search for sites, filter the sites in the list (*All Sites*, *My Sites*, *My
Favorites*), add sites to their favorites list, access the Sites Directory, and
access the Add Site wizard.

The Sites portlet is an improved version of the basic My Sites portlet. It
allows you to star various sites to customize your sites list. You can select
*All Sites* to display all the sites in the portal, *My Sites* to display all
the sites you belong to, or *My Favorites* to display your custom list of
starred sites. The option to star sites is very useful for large Social Office
instances with web applications and content hosted across many different sites.
There's also a search bar which you can use to display sites related to your
search query. If you have permission to add sites, you'll see an *Add Site*
button which opens a wizard to guide you through the site creation process. This
wizard will create a new site based on the *Default Social Office Site*
template. This site comes pre-built with pages and applications designed for
team collaboration. The *Sites Directory* button opens a site directory dialog
box which you can use to join, leave sites, or star sites. If you have the
required permissions, you can also delete sites.

![Figure 1.11: To access the Sites portlet, just click on *Go to* from the user bar. The Sites portlet lets you customize your sites list and create new Social Office sites with a simple wizard.](../../images/sites-portlet.png)

Next, a *Notifications* icon is added to the right of the *Go to* menu. The
Notifications icon displays how many unread notifications you have. You'll be
notified upon receiving a private message, an invitation to join a site, a
social connection request, or an event reminder. Alerts and announcements
created via the Alerts or Announcements portlets are accessible via the
Notifications icon. The *My Account* icon is also moved from the Dockbar to the
user bar. When you click on your name or profile picture in the user bar, four
options appear:

- *My Profile*: takes you to your public Profile page. The Profile page is the
  public home page of a Social Office user's personal site.
- *My Account*: takes you to the *My Account* section of the Control Panel where
  you can edit the details of your user account, such as your screen name, email
  address, password, etc.
- *Control Panel*: takes you to the Control Panel.
- *Sign Out*: logs you out of the portal.

The right-most item of the user bar is a gear icon that allows you to hide the
Dockbar. This can be very useful since most users won't require frequent access
to the administrative functionality provided by the Dockbar. When signed in as
an administrator, clicking on the gear icon to hide the Dockbar only works if
the *Edit Controls* box in the Dockbar is unflagged. The standard items that
appear on the Dockbar for administrators are still accessible:

- *Pin*: pins *both* the Dockbar and the user bar in place so that they're
  always accessible, even when scrolling down a long page.
- *Add*: allows you to add a new page or new portlet applications to a page.
- *Manage*: lets you access various options for managing the current page or
  site. These options are also available through the Control Panel.
- *Edit Controls*: Allows you to enable/disable the special controls (such as
  portlet options menus and maximize, minimize, and remove buttons) that are
  accessible to site administrators.

Now that we've learned how to use the Social Office user bar and seen how it
works with the Dockbar, let's learn how to use the Social Office Dashboard and
other private pages and their applications.

#### Using the Dashboard and Other Private Pages [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-using-the-dashboard-and-other-private-pages)

The private page sets of Social Office users serve as personal workspaces. Each
private page displays a navigation menu in the left column so that you can
navigate back and forth between the private pages of your personal site or
navigate to your public pages. To access the My Sites portlet, just click on the
*Go to* menu in the user bar. The private pages provided by Social Office
include:

- Dashboard
- Contacts Center
- Microblogs
- Messages
- My Documents
- Tasks

![Figure 1.10: The Dashboard navigation menu contains links to each private page of your personal site as well as a link to your public Profile page. Clicking the Social Office logo takes you to your Dashboard.](../../images/dashboard-menu.png)

The Dashboard page provides several portlet applications designed to keep you up
to date with various kinds of portal activity:

- Announcements
- Activities
- Upcoming Tasks
- Events
- Microblogs Status Update

The Announcements portlet lets you broadcast important information to different
groups of users. Each announcement can be created in a specific scope so that
you can manage which announcements are sent to which users. For more information
about using the Announcements portlet, please refer to the Liferay [User Guide](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/user-guide/-/ai/sending-alerts-and-announcements-in-you-liferay-portal-6-2-user-guide-08-en).
In Social Office, announcements created with the priority *Important* are
displayed in red while announcements with the *Normal* priority are displayed in
yellow. The default scoping of the displayed announcements in Social Office
depends on the site of the Announcements portlet. By default, the Announcements
portlet on the Dashboard shows an aggregated view of all general announcements
while an Announcements portlet on a Social Office site page also shows
site-specific announcements.

Using the power of Liferay's Social API, the Activities portlet presents
information about different categories of users' recent activities. Use the tabs
to display portal activities from different scopes:

- *Connections*: shows a list of activities of users with which you have
  established a social connection.
- *Following*: shows activities of users you're following.
- *My Sites*: shows all the activities from the sites of which you're a member.
- *Me*: shows only your own activities.

The Activities portlet consolidates related activities into a single activities
entry so the activities feeds aren't spammed with nearly identical messages. For
example, users often make several updates to an asset in quick succession, like
this:

    Bryan Cheung updated a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:48 PM
    Pricing
    Bryan Cheung updated a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:47 PM
    Pricing
    Bryan Cheung updated a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:47 PM
    Pricing
    Bryan Cheung updated a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:46 PM
    Pricing
    Bryan Cheung updated a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:46 PM
    Pricing

The Activities portlet consolidates entries like these so that only a single
message is displayed, like this:

    Bryan Cheung made 5 updates to a wiki page in Sales Team. 1:46 PM
    Pricing

For assets that allow commenting, such as blog entries, wiki articles, calendar
events, tasks, and documents and media files, the Activities portlet allows
users to comment the assets directly in the activities feed. Such comments are
translated directly as comments on the asset. Comments on *groups* of activities
are not translated as comments on the individual assets; these comments appear
only in the activities feed. Forum-related activities do not allow comments;
users have to click the link to the thread to leave a response. Since activities
feeds can quickly become heavily populated, users can simply scroll to the
bottom of a page with the Activities portlet and the Activities portlet loads
more activities.

![Figure 1.12: The default Dashboard applications are designed to inform you about recent portal announcements, activities and upcoming events, and to help you manage your personal tasks.](../../images/dashboard-applications.png)

The Upcoming Tasks portlet displays a list of tasks that have been created for
you or that you've assigned to yourself. The Events portlet integrates with the
Calendar portlet belonging to your scope to show upcoming events for the next
few days. There's also a Microblogs Status Update portlet on your Dashboard
which lets you broadcast a Facebook-like status to the scope of your choice: to
everyone, to your connections, or to your followers. Users can interact with
microblogs status updates wherever they're displayed, such as in an Activities
portlet. There are a few possible microblogs interactions: you can click a link
to view the full microblog post, comment on the post, or repost the microblog.
Next, let's take a look at the applications provided on the other private pages
of Social Office users' personal sites.

The Contacts Center is an important application for Social Office because it
allows users to create LinkedIn-style connections and Twitter-style followers.
This enables users to customize who they share information about social
activities with and whose activity they're interested in. The Contacts Center
application displays a list of portal users. You can choose to display *All*,
*Connections*, *Following*, or *My Contacts*. You can also display only the
members of a particular site. There's also a search bar so you can search for
specific users. To add a new contact, just click on the *Add Contact* button at
the top of the Contacts Center. Select a user from the left-hand area of the
Contacts Center portlet to view details about him or her. For each user, you'll
have the following options:

- *Add as Connection* sends a connection request to the selected user.
- *Follow/Unfollow* subscribes and unsubscribes you to the selected user's
  activities stream.
- *Block/Unblock* allows you to block and unblock users from viewing your
  activities stream. As of Social Office 2.0, blocking a user only prevents that
  user from following you or adding you as a connection. A blocked user can
  still send messages to and view the public profile information of the blocking
  user. 
- *Export vCard* lets you export a user's vCard and save it as a VCF file. vCard
  is a file format standard for electronic business cards.
- *Go to Profile* is a link to the selected user's public profile page.

![Figure 1.13: The Contacts Center allows you to search for users, follow users Twitter-style, and set up Linked-In style connections.](../../images/contacts-center.png)

Social Office's Microblogs application allows you to broadcast your thoughts as
a Facebook-like status to a chosen audience. You can choose for your status to
be viewable by *All*, *Connections*, or *Followers*. There are two special
symbols that you can use in your microblog posts. The hashtag symbol (`#`) turns
the following word into a hashtag. When viewing a microblog post, hashtags
appear as links. You can click on any hashtag to view a list of microblog posts
that reference the same hashtag. Note that hashtags are distinct from portal
tags--only portal tags are indexed and made available for search. The other
special symbol you can use is the mentions symbol (`@`). When you are writing
a microblog post, typing the `@` symbol brings up a list of connections to
select. Once you select a connection and publish your post, the connection's
username becomes a link to their Social Office profile page. This is the general
behavior of clicking on a username throughout Social Office. The Timeline tab of
the Microblogs portlet chronologically displays all the status posts that you
have permission to see. The Mentions tab displays all the posts in which you've
been mentioned.

![Figure 1.14: Microblogs allow users to broadcast their thoughts to a chosen audience.](../../images/microblogs.png)

Note that there are two different portlets for accessing the microblogs system:
the Microblogs portlet and the Microblogs Status Update portlet. When placed on
private pages, both portlets allow you to update your mircoblogs status. The
Microblogs portlet also allows you to view your Microblogs Timeline and Mentions
tabs. On public pages, these portlets display microblogs but don't allow you to
publish new posts. You wouldn't want to just anyone to publish microblogs under
your name, would you?

Social Office's private messaging system allows you to send email-like messages
to other users within the portal. Its interface is similar to that of an email
client. You can select messages to mark them as read or unread or mark them for
deletion. Use the *New Message* button to compose a new message. Just like with
email, you can enter a subject, a message body, and add attachments. Open the
dropdown menu next to the *To* field to select a user or users to send your
message to. You can select any number of users.

![Figure 1.15: The Private Messaging Interface functions just like an email client for use within a Social Office instance.](../../images/private-messaging.png)

Social Office provides a private document library to each Social Office user.
Users can navigate to it by clicking the *My Documents* link in the Dashboard
navigation menu. The Documents and Media portlet on the My Documents page is
exactly the same as the standard Documents and Media portlet that ships with
Liferay Portal. Please refer to the [Liferay's User Guide](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/document-manageme-6) for
information about document management.

![Figure 1.16: The Documents and Media portlet on the My Documents page is exactly the same as the standard Documents and Media portlet that ships with Liferay Portal. To optimize the Social Office user experience, set up your users with Liferay Sync.](../../images/so-document-library.png)

With their private document libraries, each of your Social Office users can
maintain a personal online repository of documents and files. Your users can use
all the features of Liferay 6.1's revamped document library, including document
previews, document types, metadata sets, and version history. However, your
users can simplify the way they access their document repositories by installing
Liferay Sync. Liferay Sync allows users to view and edit documents offline using
their regular desktop or mobile environments. Users' documents are synced with
your Liferay server at periodic intervals. You can read more about Liferay Sync
in chapter 4 of Liferay's User Guide here: [Liferay
Sync](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/lp-6-1-ugen04-liferay-sync-0).

The Tasks system allows you and your team members to keep track of different
tasks that you're working on. Tasks related to specific projects can be tagged
as such and you can use the *Filter* button at the top right corner of the
portlet to filter tasks by tag or by site. Use the *Add Task* button at the top
left to create new tasks. You can enter a description of the task, choose an
assignee from your contacts (or assign to yourself), select a priority, and,
optionally, enter a due date. It's also helpful, especially when there are large
numbers of tasks, to tag your tasks. 

![Figure 1.17: The Tasks portlet lets you create tasks and assign them to yourself or others. You can view tasks that have been assigned to you and tasks that you've created.](../../images/tasks-portlet.png)

The *Permissions* button at the top left of the Tasks portlet lets you choose
which roles grant permission to add new tasks or edit existing ones.

#### Using the Profile Page and Other Public Pages [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-using-the-profile-page-and-other-public-pages)

You can access your public Profile page from the Dashboard by clicking on your
name, which appears above the page navigation menu in the left column. Your
public pages are laid out and styled the same way as the Dashboard and the rest
of the private pages. Users' default public sites contain three pages,
accessible from the left-column navigation menu:

- Profile
- Contacts
- Microblogs

In addition to the navigation menu, the left column of each page of a Social
Office user's public site contains a My Contacts portlet. This portlet allows
viewers of a user's public site to see all the user's contacts and lets them
navigate to any of the contacts' Profile pages.

![Figure 1.18: Users' Profile pages show relevant professional information, contacts, and status updates.](../../images/profile-page.png)

By default, the Profile page displays several pieces of information about
a user: their profile and profile picture, their latest microblog status, their
contacts, the sites they belong to, their tags, and their recent activities. The
Profile portlet is designed to display relevant professional information about
a user. A completed profile includes the following pieces of information:

- Introduction
- Phones
- Addresses
- Tags
- Email Address
- Websites
- Social Network
- SMS (Chat information)

There's also a button which allows you to export the user's vCard. Once you've
been granted a Social Office account, you need to access your own profile page
and fill out your profile information. If you're viewing your own Profile page,
there's an *Edit Profile* button which opens up your *My Account* page of the
control panel in a dialog box. Currently, you need to access your *My Account*
page of the control panel to update your profile picture.

If you're viewing another user's Profile page, the *Edit Profile* button is
replaced with buttons for adding or removing the user as a connection, following
or unfollowing a user, and blocking or unblocking a user. In addition to the
Profile, Microblogs Status Update, and Activities portlets, the Profile page also
contains Sites and Tags portlets to help with navigation. Note that when placed
on a public page, the Microblogs Status Update portlet does not allow you to
make updates--it just shows the latest status update. You have to make status
updates from your private site.

The public Contacts and Microblogs applications have their own public pages.
These function the same way as the ones in a user's private site except that
other users can only view, not edit them. However, the Timeline tab of the
Microblogs portlet allows users to comment on entries.

### Using Social Office Sites For Collaboration  [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-using-social-office-sites-for-collaboration)

Social Office not only provides custom pages and applications for users'
personal sites but also for general sites that can have many members. To add a
new Social Office site to use for team collaboration, click on *Go to* from the
user bar to access the Sites portlet. Then click on the *Add Site* button. This
button opens a wizard which guides you through the process of creating a site
based on the *Default Social Office Site* template. Sites based on this template
come pre-built with pages and applications designed for team collaboration, just
like the default Social Office personal sites come with applications designed to
facilitate user interaction. The default pages created by the wizard include the
following:

- *Home*
- *Calendar*
- *Documents*
- *Forums*
- *Blogs*
- *Wiki*
- *Members*

The Add Site wizard lets you choose a site template to use to create your site's
default pages. You can also choose which of the default template pages you'd
like to include in your site. Links to these pages are embedded in the left-most
column of each page that belongs to the site. You can also select one of the
following four membership types:

- Open: The site is listed, pages are public and users are free to join and
  collaborate.
- Public Restricted: The site is listed, pages are public but users must request
  to join and collaborate.
- Private Restricted: The site is listed, pages are private and users must
  request to join and collaborate.
- Private: The site is unlisted (it's invisible to non-members), pages are
  private, and users must be invited to join and collaborate.

Note that the available site membership types of Social Office sites are
slightly different than those of regular Liferay sites. Regular Liferay sites
have only three available membership types: Open, Restricted, and Private. A
Restricted Liferay site has the same membership type as a private restricted
Social Office site. The Public Restricted Social Office site membership type has
no regular Liferay site equivalent. The default pages of an open Social Office
site are public but those of restricted and private Social Office sites are
private.

![Figure 1.19: The Social Office site wizard lets you quickly and easily set up sites for team collaboration. You can choose a site template to use to create your site's default pages, choose which template pages to include, and choose the type of your new site.](../../images/new-site-wizard1.png)

When visiting an open Social Office site, users can use the *Join* link at the
top of the page to join the site. This link, along with the *My Sites* portlet
on the Dashboard, makes it very easy for Social Office users to manage their
site memberships. This, in turn, helps them keep abreast of the activities and
content that they're interested in. The *Join* link is replaced by a *Request
Membership* link for restricted sites. When users have requested membership for
a restricted site, the *Request Membership* link is replaced by a *Membership
Requested* notification to inform users that their request is pending.

![Figure 1.21: The *Join* link appears next to the Social Office logo at the top of the page for Social Office sites.](../../images/join-site-link.png)

The Home page of the default Social Office site contains a number of useful
portlets. The Activities and Recent Downloads portlets keep site members up to
date about what's happening on the site and you can use the Announcements and
Events portlets to inform or remind site members about important information.
The Bookmarks portlet allows users to create a collection of useful links on
your site and you can configure the RSS portlet to display an RSS feed of your
choice. The Welcome portlet allows you to set up a custom welcome message for
your site. It's really just a WYSIWYG portlet with its title changed to
*Welcome*.

The Calendar, Documents, Forums, Blog, and Wiki pages contain portlet
applications that are automatically scoped for the site. This means that these
applications will each use a single data set to serve requests from multiple
members. So, while each Social Office member receives a personal Calendar
application and Documents and Media library on his or her personal site, site
members share Calendar applications and Documents and Media libraries for each
site they belong to. For more information about these applications, please refer
to Liferay's user guide, *Using Liferay Portal*, available at
[http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide). 

![Figure 1.22: Social Office's sites come with pre-built pages and applications that facilitate team-based collaboration.](../../images/social-office-site.png)

In addition to the Blogs portlet, the Blogs page contains a Recent Blogs
portlet. These two portlets are designed to work together. The Blogs portlet
allows users with the appropriate permissions to publish new blog posts. By
default, it also displays the full content of 5 recent posts. The Recent Blogs
portlet, on the other hands, displays a list of recently published blog posts.
The Recent Blogs portlet doesn't show the full content of each post. Instead,
clicking on a post's title or on the *Read More* link in the Recent opens the
full content of the post in the Blogs portlet.

Prior to Social Office 2.0, Social Office provide a Related Assets portlet on
the Blogs page. This portlet is no longer provided on the Blogs page by default
but can easily be added: just click *Add* &rarr; *More* from the Dockbar, search
for *Related Assets*, and click *Add* next to its name to add it to the page.
Whenever the Blogs portlet displays the full content of a blog post, the Related
Assets portlet lists any of the post's related assets. Click on the name of any
related asset to view the asset. If there are no related assets, the Related
Assets portlet won't appear at all.

The Members page contains a Members portlet and an Invitation portlet. By
default, the Members portlet displays a list of all the members of the site.
Using the Members portlet's dropdown selector, users can filter the set of
displayed site members. The available filters include *All*, *Administrators*,
*Connections*, and *Following*. The *Administrators* filter provides site
members with an easy way to display entries for site owners and site
administrators. This is useful for site members who need to contact site
administrators. To view a user's details, including their email address, click
on the user in the Members portlet. After clicking on a user, you can send them
connections requests, follow them, block them, send them private messages, or
download their vCards. Please refer to the section on the Contacts portlet for
more details. The Invitation portlet is only visible to site administrators. It
allows administrators to send invitations to users to join the site.

Here's an example of how it all comes together: Ryan, Jim, and Michael are all
members of the Sales Site. Ryan schedules a meeting for the whole Sales team
about a new product launch and puts it on the Calendar. When Jim and Michael log
in, they both receive a notification of the meeting. Jim can't make the meeting,
but he's been maintaining the Sales Wiki for new products, so he asks Michael to
update it for him after the meeting.

Michael updates the Wiki with the new information after the meeting, and Ryan
posts a summary of what happened in the meeting in the Sales Blog. When Jim logs
in the next day, he'll receive a notification of the new Blog post with the
information he missed, as well as a notification about the updated Wiki.
Additionally, he can easily access those pages to catch up on what he missed.
This works because Social Office automatically keeps everyone up to date on the
activities of the teams they work with every day.

### Social Office EE Features  [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-social-office-ee-features)

Social Office EE can only be installed on a Liferay EE instance; it's not
possible to install Social Office EE on Liferay CE. Social Office EE provides
several useful features in addition to the ones provided by Social Office CE.
These additional features include the following:

- A Social Office User management tool that provides an easier way to assign
  users to the Social Office User role
- Enhanced auditing tools for the Documents and Media library
- The ability to mount Documentum and Sharepoint repositories to the Documents
  and Media library.
- The ability for Liferay Sync users to sync with multiple Social Office sites
- Bug fixes and usability improvements since Social Office 2.0 CE GA2
- Access to Liferay Support

The Documentum and Sharepoint plugins that are included in Social Office EE are
the same plugins as those provided by the [Documentum Connector EE](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15098914) and
[Sharepoint Connector EE](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15188537) apps on
Liferay Marketplace. These plugins integrate Liferay's Documents and Media
functionality with Documentum and Sharepoint. They allow Documentum and
Sharepoint repositories to be mounted within Liferay's Documents and Media
system. Please refer to the Liferay Marketplace app descriptions and the
Documents and Media section of the [Liferay User Guide](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/using-external-repositori-3)
for information on properties and configuration.

After installing Social Office EE to your Liferay EE instance, you'll be
directed to the following screen when you log in as an administrator:

![Figure 1.23: The Social Office Configurations page of the Control Panel provides a quick and easy way to assign the Social Office User role to users, organizations, or user groups.](../../images/so-ee-configurations.png)

This page allows you to assign the Social Office User role to users,
organizations, or user groups. If you aren't immediately sure who should be
assigned to the Social Office User role, you can come back to this page later.
It's called Social Office Configurations and it appears at the bottom of the
Portal section of the Control Panel.

Other features provided by Social Office EE include auditing improvements to the
Documents and Media library. Once you've installed Social Office EE, you'll find
the option to specify either a major or a minor revision each time you edit or
check in a document. You'll also be prompted to enter a change log message.
Without Social Office EE, the version number will be automatically incremented
when a file is edited but there's no way to specify a major/minor revision or
enter a change log message.

![Figure 1.24: Social Office EE allows you to specify a major or minor revision and enter a change log message each time you edit or check in a document.](../../images/so-ee-doclib-checkin-screen.png)

Additionally, Social Office EE allows comments to be added to specific versions
of a document. Without Social Office EE, there's just a general comments area
for each document that's not specific to any version.

![Figure 1.25: Social Office EE allows you to comment on particular versions of files in the Documents and Media repository.](../../images/so-ee-doclib-comments.png)

If you've been using Social Office CE and upgrade to EE, any comments that were
added when you were using CE will appear in a section entitled *Previous
Comments*.

![Figure 1.26: Social Office EE allows you to specify a major or minor revision and enter a change log message each time you edit or check in a document.](../../images/so-ee-doclib-previous-comments.png)

Next, let's look at Social Office's upgrade process.

## Upgrading Social Office [](id=lp-2-1-soen01-upgrading-social-office)

Social Office 1.5b runs on Liferay Portal 5.2.7. If you're running Social Office
1.5b and you'd like to upgrade to 2.0, you first need to upgrade your portal to
version 6.1.1 CE. Please see the Upgrading Liferay section in chapter 17 of
Liferay's User Guide for details about Liferay's upgrade process:
[http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide).
Before starting the following Social Office upgrade process, make sure you've
already upgraded your portal to version 6.1.1 CE, and backed up your old
`portal-ext.properties` file, data folder, and database.

---

 ![Notice](../../images/tip.png) **Notice:** Current SO 2.0.4 CE customers
 planning to upgrade to 2.0.5 EE must *first* download and upgrade to 2.0.5 CE.
 A direct upgrade from 2.0.4 CE to 2.0.5 EE is *not* supported; attempting this
 will break Social Office.

---

---

 ![Notice](../../images/tip.png) **Notice:** There's an issue when upgrading
 from SO 2.0.5 to 2.1: Deploying newer plugins over the older plugins produces
 console exceptions when you navigate anywhere inside the portal. The reason for
 the exceptions is that the old versions of the SO plugins were not completely
 undeployed.

 As a workaround, set the following portal property before upgrading to ensure
 that all the SO plugins are completely undeployed before the newer SO plugins
 are deployed:

    hot.undeploy.on.redeploy=true

 This issue only affects upgrades from 2.0.5 to 2.1 on Liferay 6.1. It does not
 affect Liferay 6.2. It also does not affect fresh installs of SO 2.1 on Liferay
 6.1.

---

1. In your new 6.1.1 portal bundle, add the following properties into your
   `portal-ext.properties` file:

   5.2.7 uses permission algorithm 5 (comment out once data migration is
   complete).
   
    permissions.user.check.algorithm=5
    permissions.view.dynamic.inheritance=false

   6.1.1 uses permission algorithm 6 (comment in once data migration is
   complete).
   
    permissions.user.check.algorithm=6
    permissions.view.dynamic.inheritance=false

   The following property ensures that the document library uses the same
   storage method.
   
    dl.hook.impl=com.liferay.documentlibrary.util.FileSystemHook

   You do not want to index on startup/upgrade, so make sure reindex is disabled
   when you deploy the Social Office packager.
   
    index.on.startup=false index.on.upgrade=false

   Point Liferay to data folder of SO 1.5 (this may be different then your new
   data folder).
   
    resource.repositories.root={your data folder}

   The following values are taken from the default 5.2 legacy properties in the
   portal folder.

    users.image.max.height=0

    users.image.max.width=0

    locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=0

    auth.token.check.enabled=false

    image.hook.impl=com.liferay.portal.image.DatabaseHook

    cdn.host.http=${cdn.host} cdn.host.https=${cdn.host}
