Welcome to Liferay's official documentation project, the home of
[Liferay Developer Network](https://dev.liferay.com) articles. All articles are
written in
<a href="http://fletcher.github.com/peg-multimarkdown/mmd-manual.pdf" target="_blank">
Markdown</a>, making them easy to write and read. Approved articles are
uploaded to the Liferay Developer Network (LDN) and converted automatically to
HTML. In this project, you can contribute new articles, improve existing
articles, or fix documentation bugs. To produce documentation that is
comprehensive and stylistically consistent, the liferay-docs project provides
<a href="guidelines/03-writers-guidelines.markdown" target="_blank">writing guidelines</a>,
<a href="guidelines/02-standards-and-customizations.markdown" target="_blank">standards & customizations</a>,
and a
<a href="develop/tutorial-template.markdown" target="_blank">tutorial template</a>.

You'll learn how quickly to submit a new article and its images next.
