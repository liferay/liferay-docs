
# The Plugins SDK

Java developers have a wide variety of tools and development
environments. Liferay makes every effort to remain tool agnostic, so
that you can choose the tools that works best for you. For that reason
we provide a Plugins Software Development Kit (SDK) which is based on
Apache Ant and may be used along with any editor or Integrated
Development Environment (IDE). The chapters of this guide will use the
Plugins SDK and a text editor, but you may use whatever tool you are
comfortable with. In a later chapter we also introduce Liferay IDE, a
plugin for eclipse that simplifies development for Liferay.


![tip](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png)**Tip:** If you are an Eclipse
user and prefer to start working with it from be very beginning, you can
read that chapter first before reading the rest of the guide..

## Initial Setup

Setting up your environment for Liferay development is very
straightforward. First, download a fresh copy of Liferay Portal bundled
with Tomcat from the Liferay website at
[http://www.liferay.com/downloads/](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/).
We recommend using Tomcat for development, as it is small, fast, and
takes up less resources than most other servlet containers. Also
download the Plugins SDK from the *Additional Files* page:

1.  Unzip both archives to a folder of your choosing. Avoid using a
    folder name that contains spaces because some operating systems have
    problems running Java applications in folders with spaces in the
    name.

2.  (Optional) By default Liferay Portal Community Edition comes bundled
    with many plugins. It's common to remove them to speed up the server
    startup. To do this, in the
    `liferay-portal-[version]/tomcat-[tomcat-version]/webapps`
    directory, delete all the directories except for `ROOT` and
    `tunnel-web.`

3.  Start Liferay:

	-   Windows: navigate with the file browser to
    `liferay-portal-[version]\tomcat-[tomcat-version]\bin` and double
    click *startup.bat*. To shut the server down later, press Ctrl-C in
    the terminal window.

    -   Linux and Mac OS X: open a terminal, navigate to
    `liferay-portal-[version]/tomcat-[tomcat-version]/bin`, enter
    the following command

	./startup.sh

Once Liferay starts your browser should open to
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you can login with
the email `test@liferay.com` and password `test`.

### Ant Configuration

Before you can begin developing portlets, you must first have some tools
installed. Building projects in the Plugins SDK requires that you have
Ant 1.7.0 or higher installed on your machine. Download the latest
version of Ant from [http://ant.apache.org/](http://ant.apache.org/).
Decompress the archive into a folder of your choosing.

Next, set an environment variable called `ANT_HOME` which points to
the folder to which you installed Ant. Use this variable to add the
binaries for Ant to your `PATH` by adding $`ANT_HOME\bin` to your
`PATH` environment variable.

You can do this on Linux or Mac OS X by modifying your `.bash_profile`
file as follows (assuming you installed Ant in `/java`):

    export ANT_HOME=/java/apache-ant-1.8.1
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin

Close and reopen your terminal window to make these settings take
effect.

You can do this on Windows by going to *Start -\> Control Panel* ,
and double-clicking the *System* icon. Go to *Advanced*, and then click
the *Environment Variables* button. Under *System Variables*, select
*New*. Make the Variable Name **ANT_HOME** and the Variable Value the
path to which you installed Ant (e.g., `c:\java\apache-ant-1.8.1`),
and click *OK*.

Scroll down until you find the `PATH` environment variable. Select it
and click *Edit*. Add `%ANT_HOME%\bin` to the end of the Variable
Value. Click *OK*, and then click *OK* again. Open a command prompt and
type `ant -version` and press *Enter*. You should get output
similar to this:

    Apache Ant(TM) version 1.8.2 compiled on December 20 2010

If not, check your environment variable settings and make sure the directory
where you unzipped Ant is referenced in your `PATH`.

### Plugins SDK Configuration

Now that all the proper tools are in place, we must configure the
Plugins SDK to be able to deploy into your Liferay instance. You will
notice that the Plugins SDK contains a file called `build.properties`.
This file contains the default settings about the location of your
Liferay installation and your deployment folder. You can use this file
as a reference, but you should not modify it directly (In fact, you will
see the message "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" at the top if you open it). In
order to override the default settings, create a new file in the same
folder called `build.${user.name}.properties`, where
`${user.name}` is your user ID on your machine. For example,
if your user name is jsmith (for John Smith), you would create a file
called `build.jsmith.properties`.

Edit this file and add the following line:

    app.server.dir=the directory containing your application server

In our case, **app.server.dir** should be the absolute path to your
`liferay-portal-[version]/tomcat-[tomcat-version]` directory.

Save the file. You are now ready to start using the Plugins SDK.

## Structure of the SDK

Each folder in the Plugins SDK contains scripts for creating new plugins
for that type. New plugins are placed in their own subdirectory of the
appropriate plugin directory. For instance, a new portlet called
"greeting-portlet" would reside in
`liferay-plugins-sdk-6/portlets/greeting-portlet`.

The Plugins SDK can house all of your plugin projects enterprise-wide,
or you can have separate Plugins SDK projects for each plugin. For
example, if you have an internal Intranet using Liferay with some custom
portlets, you could keep those portlets and themes in their own Plugins
SDK project in your source code repository. If you also have an external
instance of Liferay for your public Internet web site, you could have a
separate Plugins SDK with those projects as well. Or you could further
separate your projects by having a different Plugins SDK project for
each portlet or theme project.

It is also possible to use use the Plugins SDK as a simple
cross-platform project generator. You can create a plugin project using
the Plugins SDK and then copy the resulting project folder to your IDE
of choice. This method requires some manual modification of the ant
scripts, but it makes it possible to conform to the strict standards
some organizations have for their Java projects.
