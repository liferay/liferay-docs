# Creating Mobile Apps that Use Liferay [](id=mobile-sdk-to-call-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The Liferay Mobile SDK is a way to streamline consuming Liferay core web
services, Liferay utilities, and custom portlet web services. It wraps Liferay
JSON web services, making them easy to call in native mobile apps. It takes care
of authentication, makes HTTP requests (synchronously or asynchronously), parses
JSON results, and handles server-side exceptions so you can concentrate on
*using* the services in your app. 

The Liferay Mobile SDK is compatible with Liferay Portal 6.2 and later. The
Liferay Android SDK and Liferay iOS SDK are ready for you to download and
use. The Mobile SDK's official project
[page](https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-mobile-sdk/overview)
gives you access to the SDK releases, provides the latest SDK news, and has
forums for you to engage in mobile app development discussions.

![Figure 8.1: Liferay's Mobile SDK enables your native app to communicate with Liferay. You can even use the SDK from Eclipse via the Liferay Mobile SDK plugin..](../../images/mobile-sdk-diagram.png)

The Liferay Mobile SDK plugin for Eclipse simplifies developing Android apps that
use Liferay. You can configure the Mobile SDKs manually to use with Android apps
and/or iOS apps. Once configured, you can invoke Liferay services from your app.
The Liferay Mobile SDK bridges your native app with Liferay services. 

In this chapter, we'll demonstrate developing Android and iOS apps that
communicate with Liferay via the Mobile SDK. Along the way, we'll discuss these
topics: 

- Setting Up the Mobile SDK
- Creating the Liferay Android Sample Project
- Calling Liferay Services in your Android App
- Using Custom Services in your Android App
- Using the Android SDK
- Using the iOS SDK

Let's get started by accessing Liferay from an Android app in Eclipse.

## Setting Up the Mobile SDK [](id=setting-up-the-mobile-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

Liferay provides the *Liferay Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin* for you to use in
developing your mobile apps. Its powerful *Mobile SDK Builder* generates
libraries that enable your app to communicate with Liferay Portal and with the
custom portlet services deployed on your Liferay Portal instance. The plugin also
comes with a *Liferay Android Sample Project* that you can use as a reference
for building more Android apps of your own. Since Eclipse only supports Android
apps, you can't use the plugin to customize iOS apps. 

The Liferay Mobile SDK plugin depends on the *Android SDK Tools* and *Android
Development Tools (ADT)* Eclipse plugins. To satisfy these dependencies, you 
can install these plugins onto an existing Eclipse instance, or you can
install Google's *Android Developer Tools SDK* bundle which includes both of
the plugins. Here are the instructions for each of these options:

- **To install the *Android SDK Tools* and *ADT* plugins manually:** Follow the
[Setting Up an Existing
IDE](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) section on the 
Android developer site to download and install the [ADT
Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) plugin to your
pre-existing Eclipse or Liferay Developer Studio/IDE installation. 

- **To install the *Android Developer Tools SDK* bundle:** Follow the
[Setting Up the ADT
Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html) section on the 
Android developer site to download and install the ADT bundle, which is built on Eclipse
and which includes the required ADT plugins.

Once you've installed the required Android plugins, you can install the
Liferay Mobile SDK to your Eclipse instance by following these steps:

1. Go to the *Help* &rarr; *Install New Software* menu.

2. Copy the following URL into the *Work with* field:

        http://releases.liferay.com/tools/ide/latest/stable/

    In the *Liferay* drop-down menu that appears, click the drop-down arrow, 
    select *Liferay Mobile SDK*, and click *Next*.

    ![Figure 8.2: Download the *Liferay Mobile SDK* plugin for Eclipse by navigating to the *Install New Software* menu.](../../images/download-mobile-sdk-plugin.png)

3. Click *Finish* to complete installing the Liferay Mobile SDK plugin.

Terrific! You're ready to start developing Android apps that use Liferay! 

Next, let's create a *Liferay Android Sample Project* to learn how easy it is to
create a mobile app that uses Liferay. 

## Creating the Liferay Android Sample Project [](id=creating-the-liferay-android-sample-proj-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

The Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin offers the ability to create a new sample Android
project from scratch. The sample project includes Liferay Mobile SDK libraries
and sample app code. We call this project the *Liferay Android Sample Project*.
You can refer to it to see how it connects with Liferay and invokes Liferay
services. Let's create the sample project now! 

1. Go to *File* &rarr; *Project...* &rarr; *Liferay* &rarr; *Liferay Android
Sample Project*.

2. Click *Next*. <!-- ... please describe the defaults we're accepting at this
screen. -->

3. Specify the *Project name*, *Location*, and *Target SDK*. Notice that you
also have the option to choose a sample project template from the Mobile SDK
preferences menu.

4. Click *Finish* to create the sample Android app.

![Figure 8.3: The Liferay Android Sample Project wizard gives you several options to customize your sample app.](../../images/mobile-sdk-sample-project-wizard.png)

The sample Android app has the standard Liferay Mobile SDK JARs as well as
sample classes that characterize how the app integrates with your portal
instance. 

<!-- You can learn more about the Android application standard architecture
by visiting Android's *Getting Started* guide. It demonstrate standard
architecture as well as activity classes, model classes, etc. 

Removing this content as it's not necessary for the developer to continue with
the tutorial. Jim
-->

The Liferay Android Sample Project lists the portal's users as contacts, so that
you can view their detailed information, including their names, email addresses,
phone numbers, and birth dates. 

Just as evidence that this sample project is using the Liferay Mobile SDK
libraries, open the sample app's `MainActivity` class from the
`src/com/liferay/mobile/sample/activity` directory. In Eclipse, scroll your
mouse over the `Session` object instance within the `onListItemClick()` method. 

![Figure 8.4: The `Session` interface is referenced from the sample app's Liferay Mobile SDK libraries.](../../images/sample-mobile-sdk-object.png)

The `Session` interface is referenced from the
`com.liferay.mobile.android.service` package. This app uses the Liferay Mobile
SDK from the library JARs in this project.

Let's run the sample app in Android's
[emulator](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html).

1. Start a local portal instance on port `8080`, if one is not already running. 

2. In Eclipse, go to *Run* &rarr; *Run As* &rarr; *Android Application*. 

3. Go to the *Liferay Contacts* app. 

The *Liferay Contacts* app lists your site's users. You can select users' 
names to see their information. 

![Figure 8.5: The sample project lets you view your local Liferay instance's user information.](../../images/liferay-contacts-app.png)

Congratulations on creating a mobile app that uses Liferay! 

Now let's consider the Android apps you've been developing. Is there data or
functionality that you'd like to leverage from your Liferay Portal instances?
The Mobile SDK enables you to use Liferay core services to get what you
need from your portal. This is easy to do with Liferay's Mobile SDK Eclipse
plugin. We'll show you how to use it next. 

## Calling Liferay Services in your Android App [](id=calling-liferay-services-in-your-android-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

The Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin makes it easier than ever for you to call Liferay
core services and utilities from your Android app. All you need to do is add the 
Liferay Android Mobile SDK libraries to your project. The Liferay Mobile SDK
Builder that comes with our Eclipse plugin enables you to generate these
libraries. 

---

![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** This configuration capability
is only available for Android apps that were created using the ADT plugin for
Eclipse. The action will not work for Android apps built with Gradle or Maven,
but you can still manually configure your project to use the Mobile SDK. For
more information on this, see the manual Liferay Mobile SDK setup instructions
for
[Android](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/tree/master/android#manually)
or
[iOS](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/blob/master/ios/README.md#manually).

---

Let's see how easy it is to set up the Liferay Android SDK in your Android app
project. 

1. In Eclipse, import your Android app into an Android application project. 

2. Right-click your app and select *Configure* &rarr;
*Add Liferay Android SDK libraries*. 

In the Eclipse console, the plugin prints a success message indicating that the
Liferay Android SDK libraries were added to the project.

Wasn't that easy? Your Android app now has the Liferay Android SDK libraries,
enabling it to call any of Liferay's core web services! Let's take a look behind
the scenes and discover what happened. 

In your project's `libs` folder, the Liferay Android SDK's `.jar` file and
`.properties` file were added. Furthermore, a JAR file containing the Liferay
Android SDK's source code was added to the project's `src` folder. Lastly, the
Liferay Android SDK library JAR was added as one of your project's *Android
Private Libraries*, making it available in your project's classpath. 

![Figure 8.6: The Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin makes it easy to inject Liferay Android SDK libraries into your app.](../../images/mobile-sdk-jars.png)

Great! Now you know how to set up your Android apps to use Liferay core web
services and Liferay utilities. But how do you access custom portlet services?
Does the Liferay Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin make that possible too? The answer is
an emphatic *YES*. We'll show you how to configure your app to use custom
portlet services next. 

## Using Custom Portlet Services in your Android App [](id=using-custom-portlet-services-in-your-an-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

The Liferay Mobile SDK makes it easier to call your custom portlet
services. The Liferay Mobile SDK Builder that comes with our Eclipse plugin
generates libraries that enable you to access your custom portlet's remote JSON
web services. 

You can specify a running Liferay Portal instance in Eclipse, and Eclipse
queries the server for all the remote APIs that are available to generate `.jar`
files to access your custom portlet services. The Liferay Mobile SDK Eclipse
plugin finds your custom services for you to select the ones you want to use in
your app. The Mobile SDK Builder generates a `.jar` file and resource files that
let you access the services in from your Android app. 

Now that you know the basic gist of how the Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin generates
custom portlet service access libraries, let's actually generate them for an
existing Android app. 

Right-click your Android app project in the Package Explorer and select
*Configure* &rarr; *Generate services for Liferay custom portlets*. This opens a
wizard where you'll specify your running portal server. 

![Figure 8.7: The Mobile SDK wizard lets you specify your Liferay portal server connection and conveniently provides the means to test that connection.](../../images/service-generation-wizard.png)

Specify your server's *URL*, *Username*, and *Password*. Notice the *Status* and
*Summary* fields; these fields indicate your running portal instance's status
after clicking the *Check Status* button.

The plugin saves previously configured server instance connection information in
a listing at the bottom so that you can configure your Android app to use any
previously configured portal server. Each server's URL and Last Available
Summary is displayed. 

Once you've checked the status of your server, click *Next*. The plugin queries
the server you specified for all the remote APIs that are available, and
generates for your custom portlet services. 

In the next menu, specify the Java package for the SDK source code that the
builder generates. Then select the custom portlet APIs that you want to access. 

![Figure 8.8: Liferay's Mobile SDK Builder queries all remote APIs that are available for generating SDK libraries to provide access to custom portlet services.](../../images/choosing-apis-and-packages-wizard.png)

For demonstration purposes, we'll specify the Java package as
`com.liferay.custom` and select an arbitrary custom API (such as the
*opensocial-portlet* &rarr; *gadget* custom API shown in the figure below). 

![Figure 8.9: The Mobile SDK Eclipse plugin injects the Android app with the appropriate `.jar` and `.properties` files to use in accessing the custom portlet APIs.](../../images/injected-jars-mobile-sdk.png)

Notice that you have the standard and custom `.jar` and `.properties` files. When
generating custom services, Eclipse adds both the standard JAR file used for
accessing Liferay core services and utilities and a custom JAR file for
accessing your custom portlet services. 

You've generated custom services for your Liferay portlets! Now your app can
access Liferay core services, Liferay utilities, *and* your custom portlet
services. 

Now that your Android app has the access it needs to use Liferay and your custom
portlets, let's take an in-depth look at using the Android SDK to invoke their
services. 

## Using the Android SDK [](id=using-the-android-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

Suppose you're creating an Android app, and you'd like to access some of
Liferay's core services. All you need to do is download the SDK and put it in
your classpath, and you can access the services immediately. If you want to
invoke custom portlet web services, you'll need to generate client libraries
for them. You can learn more about generating these libraries by reading the
[Building an SDK for Custom Portlet Services](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/build-sdk-for-custom-portlet-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)
section. 

If you're developing in an Eclipse environment and are using the Liferay Mobile
SDK Eclipse plugin, you can skip the next section. Otherwise, continue onto the
next section where we'll get started by downloading the Android SDK and
configuring it in your Android environment! 

### Manually Setting Up the Android SDK [](id=manually-setting-up-the-android-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

As we stated earlier, you'll need to download the latest version of
`liferay-android-sdk.jar`. In addition, if you want to debug the SDK source
code, you can download `liferay-android-sdk-sources.jar` and attach the source
code to your IDE project. You can download these JAR files from the Liferay
Mobile SDK [Downloads](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/releases)
page.

Once you've downloaded your JAR file, copy it into the `/libs` directory of
your Android project. Android Developer Tools should add this JAR automatically 
to your classpath. If you're using a different IDE, make sure this JAR is added
to the project classpath. Now, you'll be able to import the SDK classes for your
app to use. 

Great! Now let's start accessing Liferay services from your app. 

### Invoking Liferay Services in Your Android App [](id=invoking-liferay-services-in-your-androi-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

Now that you've downloaded the Liferay Mobile SDK for Android and placed it in
your Android project's classpath, let's consider how to access and invoke
Liferay services from within an Android application. Here are the steps to
follow: 

1. Create a session.
2. Import the Liferay services for your app to use.
3. Create a service object and call its service methods.

We'll show how the [Liferay Mobile SDK Sample Android
App](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-android-sdk-sample)
demonstrates these steps. In particular, we'll outline the steps that its
[`UsersAsyncTask`](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-android-sdk-sample/blob/master/src/com/liferay/mobile/sample/task/UsersAsyncTask.java)
class takes in accessing and calling Liferay services. In your app, you can
follow these steps too. 

#### Step 1: Create a session [](id=create-a-session-android-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The session is a conversion state between the client and server, which
consists of multiple requests and responses between the two. We need a
session to pass requests between your app and the Mobile SDK. 

The sample app establishes a session by means of user authentication. It creates
the session in the
[UsersAsyncTask](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-android-sdk-sample/blob/master/src/com/liferay/mobile/sample/task/UsersAsyncTask.java)
class as follows:

	Session session = new SettingsUtil.getSession();
 
The `getSession()` method returns a `Session` instantiated like this: 

	SessionImpl("http://10.0.2.2:8080", "test@liferay.com", "test");

Here's an explanation of each of the session parameters:

**Server:** The URL of the Liferay instance you're connecting to. If you're
running your app on an Android Emulator, the URL should point to your local
Liferay instance. In this particular case, `http://10.0.2.2:8080` is equivalent
to `http://localhost:8080`, which means the emulator and Liferay are running on
the same machine.

**Username:** Can either be the user's email address, screen name, or user ID.
Your session login user name must be consistent with the authentication method
your Liferay instance is using. Liferay's default authentication method requires
the user's email address.

**Password:** The user's password.

---

![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Warning:** Take care when using 
administrator credentials on a production Liferay instance, as you'll have
permission to call any service. Make sure not to modify data accidentally. Of
course, the default administrator credentials should be disabled on a production
Liferay instance. 

---

#### Step 2: Import the Liferay services for your app to use [](id=step-2-import-the-liferay-services-for-y-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

Being a contacts app, the sample app imports the Mobile SDK's `UserService`
class to connect to Liferay Portal's
[`UserService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/UserService.html):

	import com.liferay.mobile.android.v62.user.UserService; 

Note, the Liferay version (`.v62`) is used in the package namespace. Since the
SDK is built for a specific Liferay version, service classes are separated by
their package name. In this example, our Mobile SDK classes use the `.v62`
package, which means this SDK is compatible with Liferay 6.2. But, you can use
several SDKs in your classpath simultaneously to support different Liferay
versions. 

Your portal's JSON web services page (e.g.,
[http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws](http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws))
lists all available portal services and portlet services. 

#### Step 3: Create a service object and call its service methods [](id=step-3-create-a-service-object-and-call--liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

The sample app creates a `UserService` object and calls its
`getGroupUsers(...)` method to fetch all of the `Guest` site's users:

	UserService userService = new UserService(session);

	...

	long groupId = getGuestGroupId(session);

	JSONArray jsonArray = userService.getGroupUsers(groupId);

	for (int i = 0; i < jsonArray.length(); i++) {
		JSONObject jsonObj = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);

		users.add(new User(jsonObj));
	}

Since the `userService.getGroupUsers(...)` method requires a site group ID, we
invoke the method `getGuestGroupId(session)` of the sample app's
[`UsersAsyncTask`](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-android-sdk-sample/blob/master/src/com/liferay/mobile/sample/task/UsersAsyncTask.java)
class to get the `Guest` site's group ID, and then we pass that group ID as
the `groupId` parameter in the call `userService.getGroupUsers(groupId)`. 

---

![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** Many service methods
require a group ID as a parameter. The SDK's `GroupService` class, which uses
Liferay Portal's
[`GroupService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/GroupService.html),
provides methods for getting a site's `Group` and other scope groups. 

---

The call `JSONArray jsonArray = userService.getGroupUsers(groupId)`
demonstrates making a basic synchronous service call; the method only
returns after the request has finished. 

Service method return types can be `void`, `String`, `JSONArray`, and
`JSONObject`. Primitive type wrappers can be `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Long`,
and `Double`. 

So far, we've explained the basic process of accessing Liferay services through
the Mobile SDK. Next, we'll explore making asynchronous HTTP requests to your
portal's services. 

### Invoking Services Asynchronously from Your Android App [](id=invoke-service-asynchronously-android-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Android doesn't allow making synchronous HTTP requests from the main UI thread.
Synchronous HTTP requests must be made from threads other than the main UI
thread. For example, they can be made from an `AsyncTask` instance. 

The SDK can help you make asynchronous HTTP requests if you don't want to create
an `AsyncTask` yourself. Implement a callback class, instantiate it, and set the
callback instance on the session. When the SDK makes your service calls for that
session, it makes them asynchronously. To make synchronous calls again, set
`null` as the session's callback. 

The following steps outline how to implement asynchronous requests in your app: 

1. Implement and instantiate your callback class.
2. Set the callback on the session.
3. Call Liferay services.

The following code is an implementation of these steps: 

    import com.liferay.mobile.android.task.callback.AsyncTaskCallback;
    import com.liferay.mobile.android.task.callback.typed.JSONArrayAsyncTaskCallback;

    ...

    AsyncTaskCallback callback = new JSONArrayAsyncTaskCallback() {

        public void onFailure(Exception exception) {
            // Implement exception handling code
        }

        public void onSuccess(JSONArray result) {
            // Called after request has finished successfully
        }

    };

    session.setCallback(callback);
    userService.getGroupUsers(groupId);

Let's consider how this code asynchronously invokes the Liferay service. 

It imports the `AsyncTaskCallback` callback class and the callback class
`JSONArrayAsyncTaskCallback`, which is related to the service's `JSONArray`
return type. Then it implements and instantiates the callback class. Lastly, it
sets the callback on the session and calls the Liferay service.

The `onFailure()` method is called if an exception occurs during the request.
This could be triggered by a connection exception (e.g., a request timeout) or a
`ServerException`. If a `ServerException` occurs, it's because something went
wrong on the server side. For instance, if you pass a `groupId` that doesn't
exist, the portal complains about it, and the SDK wraps the error message with a
`ServerException`.

There are multiple `AsyncTaskCallback` implementations, one for each method
return type: `JSONObjectAsyncTaskCallback`, `JSONArrayAsyncTackCallback`,
`StringAsyncTaskCallback`, `BooleanAsyncTaskCallback`,
`IntegerAsyncTaskCallback`, `LongAsyncTaskCallback`, and
`DoubleAsyncTaskCallback`. All you'll need to do is pick the appropriate
implementation for your service method return type. In the example code snippet
above, we used a `JSONArrayAsyncTaskCallback` instance since `getGroupUsers`
returns a `JSONArray`. 

It's also possible to use a generic `AsyncTaskCallback` implementation called
`GenericAsyncTaskCallback`. For this implementation, you must implement a
transform method and handle JSON parsing yourself.

---

![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** If you still don't want to use
any of these callbacks, you can implement `AsyncTaskCallback` directly, but be
careful, you should always get the first element of the `JSONArray` passed as a
parameter to the `onPostExecute(JSONArray jsonArray)` method (i.e.,
`jsonArray.get(0)`).

---

After the request has finished, the `onSuccess()` method is called on the main
UI thread. Since the request is asynchronous, the service call immediately
returns a `null` object. The service delivers the service's real return value to
the callback's `onSuccess()` method, instead. 

Besides using synchronous and asynchronous requests, you can also send requests
using batch processing. Let's learn about this next.

### Sending Your Android App's Requests Using Batch Processing [](id=batch-android-app-requests-to-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The Mobile SDK also allows sending requests using batch processing, which can be
much more efficient than sending separate requests. For example, suppose
you want to delete ten blog entries at the same time; instead of making one
request for each deletion, you can create a batch of calls and send them all
together.

Here is a code snippet from an app that deletes blog entries synchronously as a
batch: 

    import com.liferay.mobile.android.service.BatchSessionImpl;

    BatchSessionImpl batch = new BatchSessionImpl(session);
    BlogsEntryService service = new BlogsEntryService(batch);

    service.deleteEntry(1);
    service.deleteEntry(2);
    service.deleteEntry(3);

    JSONArray jsonArray = batch.invoke();

First, the `BatchSessionImpl` session is created. You can either pass
credentials or pass another session to the constructor. Passing another session
to the constructor is useful when you already have a `Session` object and want
to reuse the same credentials. Then, it makes service calls as usual. With
asynchronous calls, these methods return a `null` object immediately. 

Finally, it calls the `invoke()` method from the batch session object. It
returns a `JSONArray` containing the results for each service call. Since there
are three `deleteEntry` calls, the `jsonArray` contains three objects. The order
of the result matches the order of the service calls. 

If you want to make batch calls asynchronously, set the callback as a
`BatchAsyncTaskCallback` instance:

    import com.liferay.mobile.android.task.callback.BatchAsyncTaskCallback;

    batch.setCallback(new BatchAsyncTaskCallback() {

        public void onFailure(Exception exception) {
        }

        public void onSuccess(JSONArray results) {
            // The result is always a JSONArray 
        }

    });

It's just that easy to make efficient service calls in batch! 

Next, let's dive into using the iOS SDK to access Liferay services.

## Using the iOS SDK [](id=use-ios-sdk-to-call-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

You've just created a custom iOS app and now want your app to access Liferay
services. How do you access Liferay services from an iOS mobile app? Use
Liferay's iOS SDK, of course. If you'd like to invoke remote web services,
you'll need to generate the client libraries. You can learn more about the SDK
builder and how to generate client libraries by reading the Custom Portlet
[Building an SDK for Custom Portlet Services](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/build-sdk-for-custom-portlet-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)
section. 

Let's get started by downloading the iOS SDK and configuring it in your iOS
environment! 

### Setting Up the iOS SDK [](id=setup-liferay-mobile-sdk-for-ios-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

To install the iOS SDK to your machine, you'll need to download the latest
version of `liferay-ios-sdk.zip`. You can download this file from the Liferay
Mobile SDK [Downloads](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/releases)
page. These installation instructions assume you're using the XCode developer
tool provided by Apple, which can be downloaded from the [Mac App
Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12).

After you've downloaded the Zip file, unzip it into your XCode project. Within
XCode, right-click on your project and click *Add Files to <PROJECT_NAME>*.
Then, add both `core` and `v62` folders. The `v62` folder name can change for
each Liferay version. In this example, the Mobile SDK is built for Liferay 6.2.

Awesome! Let's learn how to configure the SDK next.

### Invoking Liferay Services in Your iOS App [](id=access-liferay-services-from-ios-app-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

For your mobile app to access the Mobile SDK, you'll need to complete several
steps:

1. Create a session.
2. Import the Liferay services for your app to use.
3. Create a service object and call its services.

We'll demonstrate these steps by providing access to a sample Blogs app. Note
that the following code snippets are written in the *Objective C* programming
language. Let's begin! 

#### Step 1: Create a session [](id=step-1-create-a-session-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en-0)

	#import "LRSession.h"

	LRSession *session = [[LRSession alloc] init:@"http://localhost:8080" username:@"test@liferay.com" password:@"test"];

To learn more about the session and its three parameters, refer to
[Setting Up the Android
SDK](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/using-the-android-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en).

#### Step 2: Import the Liferay services for your app to use [](id=step-2-import-the-liferay-services-for-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en-0)

For this sample app, we'll import the [`BlogsEntryService`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portlet/blogs/service/BlogsEntryService.html). 

	#import "LRBlogsEntryService_v62.h"

Note the Liferay version (`.v62`) is used in the package namespacing.
Since the SDK is built for a specific Liferay version, service classes are
separated by their package name. Our Mobile SDK classes use the `.v62`
package, which means this SDK is compatible with Liferay 6.2. However, you can
use several SDKs simultaneously to support different Liferay versions.

Your portal's JSON web services page (e.g.,
[http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws](http://localhost:8080/api/jsonws))
lists all available portal services and plugin services. 

#### Step 3: Create a service object and call its services [](id=step-3-create-a-service-object-and-cal-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en-0)

For this sample app, we'll create an `LRBlogsEntryService_v62` object and
make a service call that fetches all blog entries from the *Guest* site. In
this example, the `groupId` is `10184`. 

	LRBlogsEntryService_v62 *service = [[LRBlogsEntryService_v62 alloc] init:session];

	NSError *error;
	NSArray *entries = [service getGroupEntriesWithGroupId:1084 status:0 start:-1 end:-1 error:&error];


This is a basic example of a synchronous service call, which means the
method returns only after the request is finished.

Service method return types can be `void`, `NSString`, `NSArray`,
`NSDictionary`, `NSNumber`, and `BOOL`.

---

![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** Many service methods
require a group ID as a parameter. 
You can call `[LRGroupService_v62 getUserSitesGroups:&error]`, which uses
Liferay Portal's
[`GroupService.getUserSitesGroups`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/com/liferay/portal/service/GroupService.html#getUserSitesGroups()),
to get a site group. 

---

That's it! You've given the blogs app access to the `BlogsEntryService`. Next,
let's discuss making asynchronous HTTP requests.

### Invoking Services Asynchronously from Your iOS App [](id=invoke-services-asynchronously-ios-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The SDK allows asynchronous HTTP requests; all you need to do is set a
callback to the session object. You can set the callback to `nil` if you want to
make synchronous requests again. 

Let's continue our example with the blogs app. To configure asynchronous
requests, the first thing we need to do is create a class that conforms to
the `LRCallback` protocol.

    #import "LRCallback.h"

    @interface BlogsEntriesCallback : NSObject <LRCallback>

    @end


    #import "BlogsEntriesCallback.h"

    @implementation BlogsEntriesCallback

    - (void)onFailure:(NSError *)error {
        // Implement error handling code
    }

    - (void)onSuccess:(id)result {
        // Called after request has finished successfully
    }

    @end

Then set this callback to the session and call your service as usual:

    BlogsEntriesCallback *callback = [[BlogsEntriesCallback alloc] init];

    [session setCallback:callback];
    [service getGroupEntriesWithGroupId:1084 status:0 start:-1 end:-1 error:&error];

If a server side exception or a connection error occurs during the request, the
`onFailure` method is called with an `NSError` that contains information about
the error.

Since the request is asynchronous, the `getGroupEntriesWithGroupId` method
returns immediately with `nil`, and the `onSuccess` method of your callback is
invoked with the results once the request has finished successfully.

The `onSuccess` result parameter doesn't have a specific type. Therefore, you
need to check the service method signature in order to figure out which type you
can cast it to safely. In this example, the `getGroupEntriesWithGroupId` method
returns an `NSArray`; so you can cast to this type.

    - (void)onSuccess:(id)result {
        NSArray *entries = (NSArray *)result;
    }

The `onSuccess` method is called on the main UI thread after the request has
finished.

Let's talk about another way to send your app's requests: batch processing.

### Sending Your iOS App's Requests Using Batch Processing [](id=batch-ios-app-requests-to-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Another popular method of sending requests to the Mobile SDK is through batch
processing, which can be more efficient then sending requests separately.

For example, suppose you want to delete 10 blog entries at the same time;
instead of making one request for each delete call, you can create a batch of
delete calls and send them together. Here's an example of how to do this:

    #import "LRBatchSession.h"

    LRBatchSession *batch = [[LRBatchSession alloc] init:@"http://localhost:8080" username:@"test@liferay.com" password:@"test"];
    LRBlogsEntryService_v62 *service = [[LRBlogsEntryService_v62 alloc] init:batch];
    NSError *error;

    [service deleteEntryWithEntryId:1 error:&error];
    [service deleteEntryWithEntryId:2 error:&error];
    [service deleteEntryWithEntryId:3 error:&error];

    NSArray *entries = [batch invoke:&error];

First, create an `LRBatchSession` session. You can either pass credentials or
pass another `session` to the constructor. This is useful when you already have
a `Session` object and want to reuse the same credentials. Then make the service
calls as usual. With asynchronous calls, these methods return `nil` right away.

Finally, call `[bath invoke:&error]`, which returns an `NSArray` containing the
results for each service call. Since there are three `deleteEntryWithEntryId`
calls, the `entries` array contains three objects. The order of the results
matches the order of the service calls.

If you want to make batch calls asynchronously, set the callback to the session.

    [batch setCallback:callback];

The return type for batch calls is always an `NSArray`.

As you can see, it's very simple to make efficient service calls in batch using
the iOS SDK! 

<!-- Commented out the SDK Builder content. Bruno advised that we've switched to
Gradle (instead of Ant) for building the Mobile SDK, so we'll either need to
overhaul this section, or remove it and point readers to Bruno's Github page.

Maven can also be used for building the SDK. Coordinating with Bruno and Greg on
this section and its value in the guide.

Next, let's learn how to build your custom portlet SDK and generate client
libraries. 

## Building an SDK for Custom Portlet Services [](id=build-sdk-for-custom-portlet-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

What if your app needs to access Liferay's remote services? You'll need to
generate the client libraries to access them. You can accomplish this by 
using the SDK Builder.

The Liferay Mobile SDK comes with an SDK Builder that generates the Mobile SDK
for the Android and iOS platforms. Think of it as a Service Builder on the
client side; it generates code that allows your mobile app to access your
portlet's custom services. It is template-based, making it easy to extend to
various mobile platforms. The SDK Builder generates client libraries that allow
your native mobile apps to invoke the remote web services of a portal instance
and any of its custom portlets built with Liferay's [Service
Builder](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/generating-your-service-layer-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en).

Let's configure your portlet's remote services so we can build the SDK!

### Configuring your Portlet's Remote Services [](id=configure-portlet-remote-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

In order for the SDK Builder to discover a portlet's remote services, the
portlet's services must be made available and be accompanied by a Web Service
Deployment Descriptor (WSDD).

If you're in the process of developing the portlet, see [Generating Your Service
Layer](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/generating-your-service-layer-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
for in-depth instructions on implementing remote services. For your convenience,
the following steps outline how to implement remote services for your portlet
and make them available for the SDK Builder to discover: 

1. Set your entity's `remote-service="true"` in your portlet's `service.xml`
file and run `ant build-service`.

2. Implement your remote services in the generated `[Entity]ServiceImpl.java`
source files and run `ant build-service` again. 

3. Run `ant build-wsdd` to build your Web Service Deployment Descriptor (WSDD).
The SDK Builder relies on the WSDD to discover your portlet's remote services;
so make sure to run `ant build-wsdd` before deploying your portlet.

4. Run `ant deploy` to deploy your portlet with its WSDD.

Now you're ready to use the SDK Builder to generate a custom portlet SDK for
developing your mobile app. You'll be able to invoke your service's methods,
like `[Entity]Service.bar();`, from your mobile app. The Liferay Mobile SDK
takes care of making JSON Web Service requests to your portlet.

Next, let's configure the SDK builder for building your custom portlet SDK.

### Configuring the SDK Builder [](id=configure-sdk-builder-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

In order to use the SDK Builder, you'll need to have the Liferay Mobile SDK
project on your local machine. If you haven't done so already, fork and clone
the [Liferay Mobile SDK](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk) project
from GitHub. Follow the [Fork A
Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) instructions for details.

The SDK Builder is invoked using Ant, but before building an SDK, you must set
some properties so that the SDK Builder can communicate with your portlet
services and create an SDK specific to your mobile platform. Follow the steps
below to set these properties:

1. Create a file in the root folder called `build.${username}.properties`,
where `${username}` is your computer user name.

2. Here are the important properties to set:

	* `url` - The URL to your Liferay instance.

	* `context` - Your portlet's web context. For example, if you're generating
	an SDK for Liferay's Calendar portlet, which is generally deployed to the
	`calendar-portlet` context, then you should set your context value to
	`context=calendar-portlet`. Under the hood, the SDK Builder tries to access
	`http://localhost:8080/calendar-portlet/api/jsonws?discover` to find out
	which services are available for this portlet. Check in a browser to ensure
	this URL is working before running the SDK. If it's not running, you may
	have forgotten to run `ant build-wsdd` on the portlet.

	* `filter` - Specifies your portlet's entities whose services to access; a
	blank value indicates the services of all of the portlet's entities. For
	example, the Calendar portlet has entities such as `CalendarBooking` and
	`CalendarResource`. To generate an SDK for only the `CalendarBooking`
	entity, set the filter's value to `calendarbooking`, all in lowercase. The
	SDK Builder then makes requests to
	`http://localhost:8080/calendar-portlet/api/jsonws?discover=/calendarbooking/*`.
	If you set `filter=`, specifying no filter value, the remote services of
	*all* of the portlet's entities are made available to your Mobile SDK.

	* `package` - On Android, this is the package to which your SDK's classes
	are written. The iOS platform does not use packages. Note that the Liferay
	Portal version is appended to the end of the package name. So, if you
	specified `com.liferay.mobile.android` as your package, the SDK
	Builder appends the Liferay Portal version (e.g., `v62`) to it, 
	like `com.liferay.mobile.android.v62`. Appending the Liferay Portal version
	prevents collisions between classes with the same names written for
	different versions of Liferay Portal.

	* `destination` - Specifies the root folder in which to save your generated
	files. The default destination root folder is `gen`. On Android, the files
	are saved to `[destination]/android/src`. On iOS, the files are saved to
	`[destination]/ios`.

Here's an example of configuring the SDK Builder to generate an Android mobile
SDK for a portlet with the web context value `my-portlet`:

    url=http://localhost:8080
    context=my-portlet
    filter=
    package=com.mycompany.mobile.android
    destination=gen

Now that you've configured the SDK Builder, you're ready to build a platform
specific SDK for your portlet's remote services. 

### Building the Liferay Android SDK [](id=building-the-liferay-android-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

To build the service related source files for your Liferay Android SDK, run the
following command from the `liferay-mobile-sdk` project's root folder:

    ant -f build-android.xml

The source files are written to your `[destination]/android/src` folder.

To build a `.jar` file containing the generated service and utility classes, run
the following command:

    ant -f build-android.xml jar

The `liferay-android-sdk.jar` file is written to your `dist/android/` folder.
After completing these commands, you're ready to use the
`liferay-android-sdk.jar` in your Android project and have no external
dependencies.

To learn how to use the Liferay Android SDK in your mobile app, visit the
[Using the Android SDK](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/use-the-android-sdk-to-call-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en).

### Building the Liferay iOS SDK [](id=building-the-liferay-ios-sdk-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

To build the service related source files for your Liferay iOS SDK, run the
following command from the `liferay-mobile-sdk` project's root folder:

    ant -f build-ios.xml

The source files are written to your `[destination]/ios` folder.

To build a `.zip` file containing the generated service and utility classes, run
the following command:

    ant -f build-ios.xml zip

The `liferay-ios-sdk.jar` file is written to your `dist/ios` folder. After
completing these commands, you're ready to use the contents of your
`liferay-ios-sdk.zip` file in your iOS project. Simply unzip its contents and
add all of the files to your XCode project. The SDK is free of any external
dependencies.

To learn how to use the Liferay iOS SDK in your mobile app, see the
[Using the iOS SDK](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/use-ios-sdk-to-call-services-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en).

## Summary [](id=mobile-sdk-summary-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-08-en)

In this chapter, we showed you how easy it is to download and configure
Liferay's Mobile SDK. First, we explored Eclipse's integration with the Mobile
SDK. Eclipse offers ways to build standard and custom JARs for an Android app to
reference. Eclipse also gives you the option to create a sample Liferay Android
project to familiarize yourself with a Liferay Android app using the Mobile SDK.
Then, we explained the Android and iOS mobile platforms separately, giving you
step-by-step examples for accessing Liferay services. 

<!--
Then, we explored the SDK Builder and how to generate client libraries to access
your portlet's custom services. Of course, this was also broken down into
separate Android and iOS sections so that building the SDK for either platform
is easier than ever.
