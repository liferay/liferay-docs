# Developing JSF Portlets with Liferay Faces [](id=develop-jsf-portlets-with-liferay-faces-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

![Liferay Faces logo](../../images/04-liferay-faces-logo.png)

Do you want to develop MVC-based portlets using the Java EE standard? Do you
want to use a portlet development framework with a UI component model that
makes it easy to develop sophisticated, rich UIs? Or have you been writing 
web apps using JSF that you'd like to use in Liferay Portal? If you answered yes
to any of these questions, you're in luck! *Liferay Faces* provides all of these
capabilities and more. 

Liferay Faces is an umbrella project that provides support for the
JavaServer&#8482; Faces (JSF) standard within Liferay Portal. It encompasses the
following projects:

- **Liferay Faces Bridge** enables you to deploy JSF web apps as portlets
without writing portlet-specific Java code. It also contains innovative features
that make it possible to leverage the power of JSF 2.x inside a portlet
application. Liferay Faces Bridge implements the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge
Standard. 
- **Liferay Faces Alloy** enables you to use AlloyUI components in way that
is consistent with JSF development. 
- **Liferay Faces Portal** enables you to leverage Liferay-specific utilities
and UI components in JSF portlets. 

If you're new to JSF, you probably want to know its strengths, its weaknesses,
and how it stacks up to developing portlets with CSS/JavaScript. We'll give you
information on JSF and Liferay Faces to help you decide what framework is best
for your needs. 

Here some reasons why to use JSF and Liferay Faces:

- JSF is the Java EE standard for developing web applications that utilize the
Model/View/Controller (MVC) design pattern. As a standard, the specification is
actively maintained by the JCP, and the Oracle reference implementation (Mojarra)
has frequent releases. Software Architects often choose standards like JSF
because they are supported by Java EE application server vendors and have a
guaranteed service-life according to Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
- JSF was first introduced in 2003 and is therefore a mature technology for
developing web applications that are (arguably) simpler and easier to maintain.
- JSF Portlet Bridges (like Liferay Faces Bridge) are also standardized by the
JCP and make it possible to deploy JSF web applications as portlets without
writing portlet-specific Java code.
- Support for JSF (via Liferay Faces) is included with Liferay EE support.
- JSF is a unique framework in that it provides a UI component model that makes
it easy to develop sophisticated, rich user interfaces.
- JSF has built-in Ajax functionality that provides automatic updates to the
browser by replacing elements in the DOM.
- JSF is designed with many extension points that make a variety of integrations
possible.
- There are several JSF component suites available including Liferay Faces
Alloy, ICEfaces, Primefaces, and RichFaces. Each of these component suites
fortify JSF with a variety of UI components and complimentary technologies such
as Ajax Push.
- JSF is a good choice for server-side developers that need to build web user
interfaces. This enables server-side developers to focus on their core
competencies rather than being experts in HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- JSF provides the Facelets templating engine which makes it possible to create
reusable UI components that are encapsulated as markup.
- JSF provides good integration with HTML5 markup
- JSF provides the Faces Flows feature which makes it easy for developers to
create wizard-like applications that flow from view-to-view. 
- JSF has good integration with dependency injection frameworks such as CDI and
Spring that make it easy for developers to create beans that are placed within
a scope managed by a container: `@RequestScoped`, `@ViewScoped`,
`@SessionScoped`, `@FlowScoped`
- Since JSF is a stateful technology, the framework encapsulates the
complexities of managing application state so that the developer doesn't have to
write state management code. It is also possible to use JSF in a stateless
manner, but some of the features of application state management become
effectively disabled.

There are some reasons not to use JSF. For example, if you are a
front-end developer who makes heavy use of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, you might find
that JSF UI components render HTML in a manner that gives you less control over
the overall HTML document. So, sticking with JavaScript and leveraging
AlloyUI may be better for you. Or, perhaps standards aren't a major
consideration for you or you may simply prefer developing portlets using your
current framework. 

Whether you develop your next portlet application with JSF and Liferay Faces
or with HTML/CSS/JavaScript is entirely up to you. But you probably want to
learn more about Liferay Faces and try it out for yourself. That's where this
chapter is headed. You'll start with the basics: how to use the bridge to develop
your own JSF portlet applications. From there, you'll learn how the Liferay
Faces Bridge works. After this, you'll examine using Liferay UI Components and
Utilities in JSF applications. From this, you'll be ready to graduate on to
leveraging AlloyUI components using Liferay Faces Alloy. Finally, you'll see how
to migrate an existing project to Liferay Faces, and for those who want to
contribute to the Liferay Faces project, you'll learn how to build Liferay Faces
from source. 

Your first task, however, is to learn how to develop portlets with Liferay
Faces. This will introduce you to each of the Liferay Faces projects: Liferay
Faces Bridge, Liferay Faces Alloy, and the Liferay Faces Portal Projects. We'll
explain everything from choosing the correct Liferay Faces Version for your
project, to updating your project from PortletFaces to Liferay Faces. 

Let's start developing JSF portlets using Liferay Faces. 

## Developing JSF Portlets [](id=develop-jsf-portlets-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay supports developing and deploying JSF portlets on Liferay Portal with
the help of Liferay Faces Bridge. Liferay Faces Bridge provides the means for
deploying JSF portlets on Liferay Portal. In fact, the bridge supports deploying
JSF web applications as portlets on any JSR 286 (Portlet 2.0) compliant portlet
container, like Liferay Portal 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2.  Liferay Faces Bridge
makes developing JSF portlets as similar as possible to JSF web app development.
We'll take you through the portlet development process and show you how to
leverage Liferay Faces Bridge's full potential with your JSF portlets.

In this section, you'll see how to develop JSF portlets with the standard
features you expect, as well as additional features that'll help you build JSF
applications that are powerful and easy to maintain. 

Here are the topics we'll cover: 

- Creating a JSF Portlet Project
- Specifying Your JSF Portlet's portlet.xml Descriptor
- Utilizing Portlet Preferences
- Accessing the Portlet API with ExternalContext
- Internationalizing JSF Portlets
- Utilizing IPC with JSF Portlets
- Leveraging CDI in JSF portlets
- Using Liferay Faces Bridge JSF Component Tags
- Dynamically Adding JSF Portlets to Liferay Portal
- Extending Liferay Faces Bridge Using Factory Wrappers

Let's get started with simple tutorial on creating and deploying a JSF portlet. 

### Creating a JSF Portlet Project [](id=create-jsf-portlet-project-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

We want to make it easy for you to implement portlets using JSF. And Liferay
IDE, with its powerful portlet plugin wizard, provides you with a great
environment to do just that. The wizard lets you select a component suite that's
right for your project, including JSF's standard UI component suite, ICEfaces,
Liferay Faces Alloy, PrimeFaces, and RichFaces. Of course, you can use any
development environment you like for building JSF portlets, but Liferay IDE is
hard to beat. 

You'll create a JSF portlet project using Liferay IDE/Developer Studio, so you
can see just how easy it is. If you don't have it installed yet, see 
[Chapter 2](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/developing-apps-with-liferay-ide-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-02-en)
of this guide. If you do have it installed, launch it. 

1.  Go to *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Plugin Project*. 

2.  In the project creation wizard's first window, you'll name your project and
    specify its development and runtime environments. 

    2.1 Fill in the *Project name* and *Display name* with *my-jsf-portlet*
    and *My JSF*, respectively. 

    2.2. Leave the *Use default location* checkbox checked. By default, the
    default location is set to your current Plugins SDK. If you'd like to
    change where your plugin project is saved in your file system, uncheck
    the box and specify your alternate location. 

    2.3. Select the *Ant (liferay-plugins-sdk)* option for your build type.
    If you'd like to use *Maven* for your build type, navigate to the
    [Developing Plugins Using
    Maven](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/developing-plugins-using-maven-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-02-en)
    section for details. 

    2.3. Your configured SDK and Liferay Runtime should already be selected.
    If you haven't yet pointed Liferay IDE to a Plugins SDK, click
    *Configure SDKs* to open the *Installed Plugin SDKs* management wizard.
    You can also access the *New Server Runtime Environment* wizard if you
    need to set up your runtime server; just click the *New Liferay Runtime*
    button next to the *Liferay Portal Runtime* dropdown menu. 

    2.4. Select *Portlet* as your Plugin type and click *Next*. 

3.  In this window, you'll select the portlet framework for your portlet and a
    UI component suite. 

    3.1 Select the *JSF 2.x* portlet framework. 

    Immediately, the wizard lists the available JSF component suites in the
    bottom section of the window. The list of component suites includes the
    JSF Standard suite, ICEfaces, Liferay Faces Alloy, PrimeFaces, and
    RichFaces. 

    3.2. Select the *PrimeFaces* UI component suite and click *Finish*. 

   <!-- Why do we pick PrimeFaces, when it's based on JQuery? Shouldn't we
    stick to JSF Standard? -Rich -->

Great! Your new JSF portlet plugin project is ready for you to develop JSF
portlets. 

![Figure 4.1: Liferay Faces supports using the most popular component suites with your JSF portlets.](../../images/jsf-select-primefaces-comp-suite.png)

<!-- As an alternative, we should explain how to download the JARs manually and
install them. - Jim -->

Let's make the portlet display a calendar. We'll replace the portlet's default
"hello world" text output with a PrimeFaces calendar component. 

Open the `view.xhtml` facelet file from the portlet project's `docroot/views`
folder and replace the element `<h:outputText
value="#{i18n['my-jsf-hello-world']}" />` with the following lines of code: 

    <h:form>
       <p:calendar></p:calendar>
    </h:form>

Your `view.xhtml` facelet should look like this:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    
    <f:view
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:c="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:p="http://primefaces.org/ui"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
    >
        <h:head />
        <h:body>
            <h:form>
               <p:calendar  mode="inline" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

It's time to deploy your JSF portlet to the portal and see what it looks like. 

### Deploying JSF Portlets [](id=deploy-jsf-portlets-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay provides a mechanism called auto-deploy that makes deploying portlets
(and any other plugin types) a breeze. All you need to do is drop the plugin's
`.war` file into the deploy directory, and the portal makes the necessary
changes specific to Liferay and then deploys the plugin to the application
server. This is a method of deployment used throughout this guide.

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Liferay supports a wide
 variety of application servers. Many, such as Tomcat and JBoss, provide a
 simple way to deploy web applications by just copying a file into a folder and
 Liferay's auto-deploy mechanism takes advantage of that ability. You should be
 aware though, that some application servers, such as WebSphere or Weblogic,
 require the use of specific tools to deploy web applications; Liferay's
 auto-deploy process won't work for them. 

---

**Deploying in Developer Studio**: Drag your portlet project onto your
server. When deploying your plugin, your server displays messages indicating
that your plugin was read, registered and is now available for use. 

    Reading plugin package for my-jsf-portlet
    Registering portlets for my-jsf-portlet
    1 portlet for my-jsf-portlet is available for use

If at any time you need to redeploy your portlet while in Developer Studio,
right-click your portlet located underneath your server and select *Redeploy*. 

**Deploying in the terminal**: Open a terminal window in your
`portlets/my-jsf-portlet` directory and enter

    ant deploy

A `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message indicates your portlet is now being deployed. If
you switch to the terminal window running Liferay, within a few seconds you
should see the message `1 portlet for my-jsf-portlet is available for use`. If
not, double-check your configuration. 

In your web browser, log in to the portal. Click the Add button, which appears
as a *Plus* symbol in the top right hand section of your browser. Then click
*Applications*, find the My JSF portlet in the *Sample* category, and click
*Add*. Your portlet appears on the page, but Liferay Faces lets you know when a
UI component requires a page refresh to render the first time. 

Refresh the page and the portal renders your portlet's calendar component. 

![Figure 4.2: Powerful UI components, like this PrimeFaces calendar, are a snap to include in your portlet UI.](../../images/jsf-primefaces-portlet-with-calendar.png) 

It's just that easy to create and deploy JSF portlet plugins! 

Next, let's get familiar with the portlet deployment descriptor file
(`portlet.xml`) and consider the descriptor requirements for JSF portlets. 

### Specifying the portlet.xml for Your JSF Portlet [](id=portlet-xml-file-jsf-portlet-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Each portlet project must have a `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` deployment descriptor
file. As we demonstrated in the previous section, Liferay IDE and the Plugins
SDK create this file for you. But there are a couple unique requirements for JSF
portlets with respect to their deployment descriptors. 

First, using JSF 2.x in a portlet requires specifying
`javax.portlet.faces.GenericFacesPortlet` as the portlet's class. You specify
this class name in the portlet's `<portlet-class>` entity. Notice that the
portlet in the following `portlet.xml` snippet meets this requirement: 

    <portlet-app>
        <portlet>
            <portlet-name>jsf_portlet</portlet-name>
            <display-name>JSF Portlet</display-name>
            <portlet-class>
                javax.portlet.faces.GenericFacesPortlet
            </portlet-class>
            <init-param>
                <name>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.view</name>
                <value>/view.xhtml</value>
            </init-param>
            <init-param>
                <name>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.edit</name>
                <value>/preferences.xhtml</value>
            </init-param>
            <init-param>
                <name>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.help</name>
                <value>/help.xhtml</value>
            </init-param>
            <supports>
                <mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
                <portlet-mode>view</portlet-mode>
                <portlet-mode>edit</portlet-mode>
                <portlet-mode>help</portlet-mode>
            </supports>

            ...

        </portlet>
    </portlet-app>

Second, each portlet must map a facelet to each portlet mode that it supports.
The `portlet.xml` file content above supports the `VIEW`, `EDIT`, and `HELP`
portlet modes, and maps each of those modes to a specific facelet. 

In the example code above, `VIEW` mode support is specified by the
`<portlet-mode>view</portlet-mode>` element. The `VIEW` mode is mapped
to the `/view.xhtml` facelet by the `<init-param>` element:

    <init-param>
        <name>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.view</name>
        <value>/view.xhtml</value>
    </init-param>

Now that we've got `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` set up, let's move on to portlet
preferences. 

### Using Portlet Preferences with JSF [](id=use-portletpreferences-with-jsf-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

JSF portlet developers often must enable the end-user to personalize portlets
in some way. To meet this requirement, the Portlet 2.0 specification lets you
define portlet preferences for each portlet. Preference names and default values
are defined in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. Portal end-users start
out interacting with the portlet user interface in portlet `VIEW` mode but
switch to portlet `EDIT` mode in order to select custom preference values. 

    <portlet-preferences>
        <preference>
            <name>datePattern</name>
            <value>MM/dd/yyyy</value>
        </preference>
    </portlet-preferences>

Additionally, Portlet 2.0 lets you specify support for `EDIT` mode in the
`WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. 

    <supports>
        <mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
        <portlet-mode>view</portlet-mode>
        <portlet-mode>edit</portlet-mode>
    </supports>

Although support for portlet `EDIT` mode has been specified, the portlet
container does not necessarily know which JSF view should be rendered when the
user enters portlet `EDIT` mode. JSF portlet developers must specify the
Facelet view in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor that should be displayed
for each supported portlet mode. 

    <init-param>
        <name>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.edit</name>
        <value>/edit.xhtml</value>
    </init-param>

<!-- This example's mapping values are slightly different from that of the
portlet in the previous section. Were they meant to be different? In the
previous example descriptor we mapped EDIT mode to the /preferences.xhtml
facelet, yet in this example we map EDIT mode to the /edit.xhtml facelet. This
seems confusing. - Jim -->

Now that we've considered how to implement portal preferences, let's learn how
to access the Portlet API. 

### Accessing the Portlet API with ExternalContext [](id=access-portlet-api-with-externalcontext-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Just as JSF *web app* developers rely on `ExternalContext` to access to the
Servlet API, JSF *portlet* developers rely on it to access to the Portlet API. 

As you develop JSF portlets, you'll often need to access instances of the
`javax.portlet.PortletRequest` and `javax.portlet.PortletResponse` classes. You
access these instances similarly to how you'd access the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` and
`javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse` classes in a servlet environment, except
that you cast them to the portlet versions of the classes. 

In the example code snippet below, the request object from
`externalContext.getRequest()` is cast to the `PortletRequest` class and the
response object from `externalContext.getResponse()` is cast to the
`PortletResponse` class:

    import javax.portlet.PortletRequest;
    import javax.portlet.PortletResponse;
    ....

    public class PortletBackingBean {

        public void submit() {
            FacesContext facesContext =
                FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();

            ExternalContext externalContext =
                facesContext.getExternalContext();

            PortletRequest portletRequest =
                (PortletRequest) externalContext.getRequest();

            PortletResponse portletResponse =
                (PortletResponse) externalContext.getResponse();
        }
    }
 
The code listing above uses the singleton class `LiferayFacesContext`, which has
methods `getPortletRequest()` and `getPortletResponse()`. You can leverage the
`LiferayFacesContext` class in your JSF portlets on Liferay to get easy access
to the portlet requests and responses. This class comes with Liferay Faces
Portal, which we'll cover in detail in later sections. 

<!-- I think more explanation here is necessary. There's no indication in the
code that LiferayFacesContext is the implementation that's returned, and there's
no explanation as to why you didn't use the getPortletRequest() and
getPortletResponse() methods. I can assume from reading it that you didn't use
them because you were going for a more generic, portlet container-friendly
implementation in this first example, but I (and the reader) am not sure of
that. -Rich -->

In the next section, we'll explain how to internationalize your JSF portlets. 

### Internationalizing JSF Portlets [](id=internationalize-jsf-portlets-i18n-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

There are at least two ways to handle internationalization with JSF portlets in
Liferay Portal: 

1. Using the standard JSF mechanism to create your own *i18n* keyword, as shown in the [jsf2-portlet](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos#jsf2-portlet)
   demo.
    - Create a properties file in the classpath like
    [`i18n.properties`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/resources/i18n.properties)
    - Create a `<resource-bundle>` entry in the `<faces-config>` element, as
    demonstrated in
    [`faces-config.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/faces-config.xml)
    - Use your custom *i18n* keyword Expression Language (EL) in your Facelet
    view, like [`applicant.xhtml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/webapp/views/applicant.xhtml)

2. Using the built-in *i18n* keyword provided by [Liferay Faces
   Portal](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/portal),
   as shown in the
   [jsf2-registration-portlet](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos#jsf2-registration-portlet)
   demo. This method integrates JSF and Liferay very well, because it allows you
   to "hook" into thousands of existing internationalized keys that Liferay
   Portal includes and allows you to add your own keys. 
    - Create a hook, like
    [`liferay-hook.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/portal/jsf2-registration-portlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/liferay-hook.xml),
    inside your portlet plugin
    - Create internationalized Langauge properties files, like
    [`Language_en_US.properties`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/portal/jsf2-registration-portlet/src/main/resources/Language_en_US.properties) 
    - Use the built-in *i18n* keyword Expression Language (EL) in your Facelet
    view, like
    [`registrant.xhtml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/demos/portal/jsf2-registration-portlet/src/main/webapp/views/registrant.xhtml) 

<!-- This section on JSF portlet i18n needs to be refactored to demonstrate,
with code, how to internationalize a JSF portlet. - Jim -->

Internationalizing your portlets is especially easy to do using the options that
Liferay Faces provides. 

Next, we'll learn how to communicate between JSF portlets using IPC. 

### Using IPC with JSF Portlets [](id=utilizing-ipc-with-jsf-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge supports Portlet 2.0 Inter Portlet Communication (IPC),
using the JSR 329 approach for supporting Portlet 2.0 Events and Portlet 2.0
Public Render Parameters. 

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Visit
 <http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos> to see
 portlets that demonstrate the IPC techniques described in this section. At that
 location, you'll also find portlets that implement Ajax Push for IPC, using
 ICEfaces+ICEPush and PrimeFaces+PrimePush. 

---

#### Using Portlet 2.0 Public Render Parameters [](id=portlet-2-0-public-render-parameters-jsf-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The Public Render Parameters technique provides a way for portlets to share data
by setting public/shared parameter names in a URL controlled by the portal.
While the benefit of this approach is that it is relatively easy to implement,
the drawback is that only small amounts of data can be shared. Typically the
kind of data that is shared is simply the value of a database primary key. As
required by the Portlet 2.0 standard, Public Render Parameters must be declared
in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. 

This example excerpt from a `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor demonstrates
setting a public render parameter for a customer ID, shared between a Customers
portlet and a Bookings portlet: 

    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>customersPortlet</portlet-name>
        <supported-public-render-parameter>selectedCustomerId</supported-public-render-parameter>
    </portlet>
    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>bookingsPortlet</portlet-name>
        <supported-public-render-parameter>selectedCustomerId</supported-public-render-parameter>
    </portlet>
    <public-render-parameter>
        <identifier>selectedCustomerId</identifier>
        <qname xmlns:x="http://liferay.com/pub-render-params">x:selectedCustomerId</qname>
    </public-render-parameter>

Fortunately, the JSR 329 standard defines a mechanism for you to use Portlet 2.0
Public Render Parameters for IPC in a way that is more natural to JSF
development. Section 5.3.2 of this standard requires the bridge to inject the
public render parameters into the Model concern of the MVC design pattern (as in
JSF model managed-beans) after the `RESTORE_VIEW` phase completes. This is
accomplished by evaluating the EL expressions found in the
`<model-el>...</model-el>` section of the `WEB-INF/faces-config.xml` descriptor.
The `WEB-INF/faces-config.xml` descriptor excerpt below demonstrates using this
mechanism in the example Customers portlet and Bookings portlet:

    <faces-config>
        <application>
            <application-extension>
                <bridge:public-parameter-mappings>
                    <bridge:public-parameter-mapping>
                        <parameter>customersPortlet:selectedCustomerId</parameter>
                        <model-el>#{customersModelBean.selectedCustomerId}</model-el>
                    </bridge:public-parameter-mapping>
                    <bridge:public-parameter-mapping>
                        <parameter>bookingsPortlet:selectedCustomerId</parameter>
                        <model-el>#{bookingsModelBean.selectedCustomerId}</model-el>
                    </bridge:public-parameter-mapping>
                </bridge:public-parameter-mappings>
            </application-extension>
        </application>
    </faces-config>

Section 5.3.2 of the JSR 329 standard also requires that if a
`bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler` has been registered in the
`WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor, then the handler must be invoked so that it
can perform any processing that might be necessary. Optionally, you can
implement and register a `bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler` for processing
public render parameters. 

For example, a `BridgePublicRenderParameterHandler` for processing public render
params for the Bookings portlet's currently selected Customer could be
stubbed out like the following class code: 

    package com.liferay.faces.example.handler;

    import javax.faces.context.FacesContext;

    import com.liferay.faces.bridge.BridgePublicRenderParameterHandler;

    public class CustomerSelectedHandler
    implements BridgePublicRenderParameterHandler {

        public void processUpdates(FacesContext facesContext) {
            // Here is where you would perform any necessary processing of public
            // render parameters
        }

    }

For the `BridgePublicRenderParameterHandler` to be invoked, it must be
registered in an `<init-param>` element within the portlet's `<portlet>` element
in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor: 

    <init-param>
        <name>javax.portlet.faces.bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler</name>
        <value>com.liferay.faces.example.handler.CustomerSelectedHandler</value>
    </init-param>

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** For a complete example demonstrating
 public render parameters and a `bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler`, see the
 [JSF2 IPC Public Render Parameters Portlet](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/tree/3.1.3-ga4/demos/bridge/jsf2-ipc-pub-render-params-portlet)
 demo on GitHub.
 
---

Now that we've discussed Public Render Parameters for JSF in IPC, let's look at
Events in IPC. 

#### Handling Portlet 2.0 Events [](id=portlet-2-0-events-jsf-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

In Portlet 2.0, you can leverage a server-side events technique that uses an
event-listener design to share data between portlets. When using this form of
IPC, the portlet container acts as broker and distributes events and payload
(data) to portlets. One requirement of this approach is that the payload must
implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface since it might be sent to a
portlet in another WAR running in a different classloader. In addition, the
Portlet 2.0 standard requires the events to be declared in the
`WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptors of the involved portlets. 

The following example `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor snippet defines an IPC
event for when a Customer is edited in the example Bookings portlet. The
`bookingsPortlet` portlet is registered as the event's publisher (or sender).
The `customersPortlet` portlet, on the other hand, is registered as a processor
(or listener) for that event type. Consequently, when a Customer is edited in
the `bookingsPortlet` portlet, that portlet publishes the event and the
`customersPortlet` portlet is notified for processing the event. 

Here's a snippet from the example's `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor:

    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>customersPortlet</portlet-name>
        <supported-processing-event>
            <qname xmlns:x="http://liferay.com/events">x:ipc.customerEdited</qname>
        </supported-processing-event>
    </portlet>
    <portlet>
        <portlet-name>bookingsPortlet</portlet-name>
        <supported-publishing-event>
            <qname xmlns:x="http://liferay.com/events">x:ipc.customerEdited</qname>
        </supported-publishing-event>
    </portlet>

    ....

    <event-definition>
        <qname xmlns:x="http://liferay.com/events">x:ipc.customerEdited</qname>
        <value-type>com.liferay.faces.example.dto.Customer</value-type>
    </event-definition>

Optionally, you can implement a `BridgeEventHandler` for an event type and
register the handler in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. If a
`BridgeEventHandler` has been registered in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml`
descriptor, Section 5.2.5 of the JSR 329 standard requires that the handler must
be invoked so that it can perform any event processing that might be necessary. 

When the customer's details (such as first name/last name) are edited in the
Bookings portlet, the event named `ipc.customerEdited` is sent back to the
Customers portlet and is processed by the following
`CustomerEditedEventHandler` class: 

    ...

    import javax.faces.context.FacesContext;
    import javax.portlet.Event;
    import javax.portlet.faces.BridgeEventHandler;
    import javax.portlet.faces.event.EventNavigationResult;

    ...

    public class CustomerEditedEventHandler implements BridgeEventHandler {

            ....

            public EventNavigationResult handleEvent(FacesContext facesContext, Event event) {
                    EventNavigationResult eventNavigationResult = null;
                    String eventQName = event.getQName().toString();
    
                    if (eventQName.equals("{http://liferay.com/events}ipc.customerEdited")) {
                        ...
                    }
    
                    return eventNavigationResult;
            }

            ....
    }

And here's the descriptor for registering the `CustomerEditedEventHandler` class
as a bridge event handler for the Customers portlet.  The following
`<init-param>` belongs in the Customers portlet's `<portlet>` element, in the
`WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. 

    <init-param>
        <name>javax.portlet.faces.bridgeEventHandler</name>
        <value>com.liferay.faces.example.event.CustomerEditedEventHandler</value>
    </init-param>

Now that we've discussed some common basic JSF portlet development topics, let's
consider how to use dependency injection in JSF portlets. 

### Developing JSF Portlets with CDI [](id=developing-jsf-portlets-with-cdi-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

<!-- Explain what CDI is, the benefits of using it and any drawbacks to using
it. - Jim -->

<!-- I think the below paragraph does some of that. It explains that CDI is the
dependency injection standard for Java (as opposed to Spring). It explains that
it's a part of both Java EE 6 and 7, and that it's required by the Faces Flows
feature; thus you'll need to know it and use it if you're using that feature.
-Rich -->

In December 2009, [JSR 299](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299) introduced the
Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 1.0 standard into the Java EE 6
platform. In April 2013, [JSR 346](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346) updated
CDI to version 1.1 for Java EE 7. In addition, [JSR
344](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=344), the JSF 2.2 specification which is
another component of Java EE 7, introduced a dependency on the CDI API for the
`javax.faces.view.ViewScoped` annotation and for the Faces Flows feature. JBoss
[Weld](http://seamframework.org/Weld) is the Reference Implementation (RI) for
CDI and Apache [OpenWebBeans](http://openwebbeans.apache.org/) is another open
source implementation. 

In this section we'll cover the following topics: 

- Configuring CDI on Liferay Portal
- Configuring the Liferay CDI Portlet Bridge
- Understanding CDI in JSF Annotations

Let's look at configuring Weld on Liferay Portal for leveraging CDI with JSF
portlets. 

#### Configuring CDI on Liferay Portal [](id=configure-weld-cdi-with-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

You must use one of the following portal/app-server combinations to use Weld
with Liferay Portal: 

- Liferay Portal 6.1/6.2 (Tomcat)
- Liferay Portal 6.1/6.2 (GlassFish)
    - Apply patch attached to [LPS-35558](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-35558).
    - [Upgrade Mojarra in GlassFish](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Upgrading+Mojarra+in+Oracle+GlassFish)
      to version 2.1.21 (or higher).
    - [Upgrade Weld in GlassFish](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Upgrading+Weld+in+Oracle+GlassFish)
      to version 1.1.10.Final (or higher).
- Liferay Portal 6.1/6.2 (JBoss AS)
    - Apply patch attached to [LPS-35558](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-35558)
    - [Upgrade Mojarra in JBoss AS](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki?p_p_id=36&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_36_struts_action=%2Fwiki%2Fedit_page&_36_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%2Fcommunity%2Fwiki%2F-%2Fwiki%2FMain%2FDeveloping%2BJSF%2BPortlets%2Bwith%2BCDI&p_r_p_185834411_nodeId=1071674&p_r_p_185834411_title=%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%2Fcommunity%2Fwiki%2F-%2Fwiki%2FMain%2FUpgrading%2BMojarra%2Bin%2BJBoss%2BAS)
      to version 2.1.21 (or higher). 
    - [Upgrade Weld in JBoss AS](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki?p_p_id=36&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_36_struts_action=%2Fwiki%2Fedit_page&_36_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%2Fcommunity%2Fwiki%2F-%2Fwiki%2FMain%2FDeveloping%2BJSF%2BPortlets%2Bwith%2BCDI&p_r_p_185834411_nodeId=1071674&p_r_p_185834411_title=%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.liferay.com%2Fcommunity%2Fwiki%2F-%2Fwiki%2FMain%2FUpgrading%2BWeld%2Bin%2BJBoss%2BAS)
      to version 1.1.10.Final (or higher). 
- Liferay Portal 6.1/6.2 (Resin)

When developing portlets with CDI 1.0, you must include a `WEB-INF/beans.xml`
descriptor in your JSF portlet plugin's WAR deployment, so that the CDI
implementation can detect the CDI-related annotations of your classes when it
scans the classpath. 

Here's an example `WEB-INF/beans.xml` descriptor: 

    <beans xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/beans_1_0.xsd">
    </beans>
 
For JBoss AS 7, you must also include a `WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml`
descriptor in your portlet plugin's WAR deployment to include the CDI-related
modules. Here's an example of a `WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml`
descriptor for JBoss: 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <jboss-deployment-structure xmlns="urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.0">
        <deployment>
            <exclusions>
                <module name="javaee.api" />
                <module name="org.apache.log4j" />
            </exclusions>
            <dependencies>
                <module name="com.liferay.portal" />
                <module name="javax.annotation.api" />
                <module name="javax.enterprise.api" />
                <module name="javax.inject.api" />
                <module name="javax.interceptor.api" />
                <module name="javax.validation.api" />
                <module name="javax.mail.api" />
                <module name="org.jboss.modules" />
            </dependencies>
        </deployment>
    </jboss-deployment-structure>

<!-- Recommend we take out all the app server configuration stuff below and
bake it into the app server sections in the User Guide. -Rich -->

Next, we'll cover Weld configuration on the app server. Their are some different
configuration steps for different app servers. We'll look at the most common
configuration steps first. 

For most app servers (excluding Resin), the portlet's `WEB-INF/web.xml`
descriptor must include the following filter and filter mapping: 

    <filter>    
        <filter-name>WeldCrossContextFilter</filter-name>    
        <filter-class>org.jboss.weld.servlet.WeldCrossContextFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>    
        <filter-name>WeldCrossContextFilter</filter-name>    
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>    
        <dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>    
        <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>    
        <dispatcher>ERROR</dispatcher>
    </filter-mapping>

If you are using Resin as your app server, you don't need JBoss Weld, as Resin
includes the [CanDI](http://www.caucho.com/candi-java-dependency-injection/)
implementation of CDI by default. 

The next section contains information about specifically configuring Tomcat, so
developers running other application servers can skip it. 

**Additional Weld Configuration for Tomcat**

If Weld is running in a Java EE application server like Oracle GlassFish or
JBoss AS, then Weld is automatically included in the global classpath. But on
Tomcat, it is necessary to include the `weld-servlet.jar` dependency in either
the `tomcat/lib` global classpath, or directly in the `WEB-INF/lib` folder of a
portlet: 

    <!-- Required only for Tomcat -->
    <dependency>    
        <groupId>org.jboss.weld.servlet</groupId>    
        <artifactId>weld-servlet</artifactId>    
        <version>1.1.10.Final</version>
    </dependency>

<!-- The above instructions look like Maven stuff, and Maven isn't mentioned
here. -Rich -->

Additionally, the following listener must be added to the `WEB-INF/web.xml`
descriptor: 

    <!-- Required only for Tomcat -->
    <listener>    
        <listener-class>org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.Listener</listener-class>
    </listener>

Next we'll discuss configuring the Liferay CDI Portlet Bridge. 

#### Configuring the Liferay CDI Portlet Bridge [](id=configure-liferay-cdi-portlet-bridge-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The Liferay CDI Portlet Bridge makes it possible to use CDI with your JSF
portlets on Liferay. Your JSF portlet projects must include the Liferay CDI
Portlet Bridge as a dependency.

For example, to specify the bridge dependency in a Maven project for Liferay
6.2, you'd add the following `<dependency>` to your POM's `<dependencies>`
element: 

    <dependency>    
        <groupId>com.liferay.cdi</groupId>    
        <artifactId>cdi-portlet-bridge-shared</artifactId>    
        <version>6.2.0.2</version>
    </dependency>

The `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor of the portlet must include the following
markup: 

    <filter>    
        <filter-name>CDIPortletFilter</filter-name>    
        <filter-class>com.liferay.cdi.portlet.bridge.CDIPortletFilter</filter-class>
        <lifecycle>ACTION_PHASE</lifecycle>
        <lifecycle>EVENT_PHASE</lifecycle>
        <lifecycle>RENDER_PHASE</lifecycle>
        <lifecycle>RESOURCE_PHASE</lifecycle>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>CDIPortletFilter</filter-name>    
        <portlet-name>my-portlet-name</portlet-name>
    </filter-mapping>

Additionally, the portlet's `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor must include the
following markup: 

    <filter>
        <filter-name>CDICrossContextFilter</filter-name>
        <filter-class>com.liferay.cdi.portlet.bridge.CDICrossContextFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>CDICrossContextFilter</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
        <dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>
        <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
        <dispatcher>ERROR</dispatcher>
    </filter-mapping>
    <listener>
        <listener-class>com.liferay.cdi.portlet.bridge.CDIContextListener</listener-class>
    </listener>

---

 ![Tip](../../images/tip.png) **Tip:** The Liferay Faces Project features the
 [jsf2-cdi-portlet](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos#jsf2-cdi-portlet) 
 demo (which is a variant of the
 [jsf2-portlet](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos#jsf2-portlet)
 demo). It's a good idea download and deploy the jsf2-cdi-portlet demo in your
 development environment in order to verify that CDI functions properly. 

---

Now that everything is configured, you are ready to begin development with CDI.

#### Understanding CDI in JSF Annotations [](id=cdi-jsf-annotations-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

When developing portlets with CDI, it is possible to annotate Java classes as
CDI managed beans with
[`@Named`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Named.html) with the
following scopes: 

| CDI Annotation | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| [`@ApplicationScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/ApplicationScoped.html) | An `@ApplicationScoped` managed bean exists for the entire lifetime of the portlet application. |
| [`@ConversationScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/ConversationScoped.html) | A `@ConversationScoped` managed bean is created when `Conversation.begin()` is called and is scheduled for garbage collection when `Conversation.end()` is called. |
| [`@FlowScoped`](https://javaserverfaces.java.net/nonav/docs/2.2/javadocs/javax/faces/flow/FlowScoped.html) | A `@FlowScoped` managed bean is created when a JSF 2.2 Flow begins and scheduled for garbage collection when a JSF 2.2 Flow completes. |
| [`@RequestScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/RequestScoped.html) | A `@RequestScoped` managed bean exists during an `ActionRequest`, `RenderRequest`, or `ResourceRequest`. Beans that are created during the `ActionRequest` do not survive into the `RenderRequest`. |
| [`@SessionScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/SessionScoped.html) | A `@SessionScoped` managed bean exists for the duration of the user session. |

In addition to CDI scope annotations, it's important to understand JSF 2
annotations and their equivalence to CDI annotations. 

| JSF Annotation | Equivalent CDI Annotation |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| `javax.faces.ManagedBean` | [`javax.inject.Named`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Named.html) |
| `javax.faces.ApplicationScoped` | [`javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/ApplicationScoped.html) |
| `javax.faces.RequestScoped` | No such equivalent, since [`javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/RequestScoped.html) does not span portlet lifecycle phases. 
| `javax.faces.SessionScoped` | [`javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/enterprise/context/SessionScoped.html) |
| `javax.faces.ManagedProperty` (corresponding setter method required) | [`javax.inject.Inject`](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Inject.html) (corresponding setter method not required) |

Now that we have discussed JSF portlet development with CDI, let's take a
look at some UI component tags included with Liferay Faces Bridge. 

### Using Liferay Faces Bridge JSF Component Tags [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-jsf-component-tags-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Although the JSR 329 standard does not define any JSF components that bridge
implementations are required to provide, Liferay Faces Bridge comes with a
handful of components that are helpful to use in JSF portlets. 

Because Liferay Faces has several [active versions](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
(targeting different versions of JSF, Liferay Portal, etc.), there are several
versions of the project View Declaration Language (VDL) documentation for these
tags. The VDL documentation can be found at the following addresses: 

- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>.

<!-- Re-add VDLs for 4.1 and 4.2 when released. - Jim
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 4.1 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 4.2 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>.
-->

Liferay Faces Bridge provides the following UI component tags under the `bridge`
and `portlet` namespaces for the Bridge and Portlet 2.0 tags respectively. Let's
look at the Bridge tags first. 

#### Bridge UIComponent Tags [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-uicomponent-tags-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge provides the following bridge-specific `UIComponent` tags as
part of its component suite. 

The `bridge:inputFile` tag renders an HTML `<input type="file"/>` tag, providing
file upload capability. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:bridge="http://liferay.com/faces/bridge"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body>
            <h:form>
                <bridge:inputFile fileUploadListener="#{backingBean.handleFileUpload}" multiple="multiple" />
                <h:commandButton value="Submit" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

Here's a code snippet from a class that imports the `FileUploadEvent` class and
implements handling the file upload: 

    import com.liferay.faces.bridge.event.FileUploadEvent;

    ...

    @ManagedBean(name = "backingBean")
    @ViewScoped
    public class ApplicantBackingBean implements Serializable {

            public void handleFileUpload(FileUploadEvent fileUploadEvent)
            throws Exception {
                UploadedFile uploadedFile = fileUploadEvent.getUploadedFile();
                System.err.println("Uploaded file:" + uploadedFile.getName());
            }
        }
    }

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Usage of this tag requires the Apache
 `commons-fileupload` and `commons-io` dependencies. See the [Demo JSF2
 Portlet](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/demos#jsf2-portlet)
 for more details.

Next, let's learn about the Portlet `UIComponent` tags available in Liferay Faces
Bridge. 

#### Portlet 2.0 UIComponent Tags [](id=faces-bridge-portlet-2-0-uicomponent-tags-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge provides the following Portlet 2.0 `UIComponent` tags as
part of its component suite. 

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Although JSP tags are provided by the
 portlet container  implementation, Liferay Faces Bridge provides these tags in
 order to support their usage within Facelets. 

---

The first tag we'll look at is `portlet:actionURL`.

If the `var` attribute is present, the `portlet:actionURL` tag introduces an EL
variable that contains a `javax.portlet.ActionURL`, adequate for postbacks.
Otherwise, the URL is written to the response. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:portlet="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body">
            <h:form>
                <portlet:actionURL var="myActionURL" >
                    <portlet:param name="foo" value="1234" />
                </portlet:actionURL>
                <h:outputText var="actionURL=#{myActionURL}" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

Next, we'll look at an example of the `portlet:namespace` tag.

If the `var` attribute is present, the `portlet:namespace` tag introduces
an EL variable that contains the portlet namespace. Otherwise, the
namespace is written to the response.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:portlet="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body">
            <h:form>
                <portlet:namespace var="mynamespace" />
                <h:outputText var="namespace=#{mynamespace}" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

The `portlet:param` tag is up next.

The `portlet:param` tag lets you add a request parameter name=value pair when
nested inside `portlet:actionURL`, `portlet:renderURL`, or `portlet:resourceURL`
tags. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:portlet="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body">
            <h:form>
                <portlet:actionURL>
                    <portlet:param name="foo" value="1234" />
                </portlet:actionURL>
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

The next tag we'll look at is the `portlet:renderURL` tag.

If the `var` attribute is present, the `portlet:renderURL` tag introduces an EL
variable that contains a `javax.portlet.PortletURL`, adequate for rendering.
Otherwise, the URL is written to the response. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:portlet="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body">
            <h:form>
                <portlet:renderURL var="myRenderURL">
                    <portlet:param name="foo" value="1234" />
                </portlet:renderURL>
                <h:outputText var="actionURL=#{myRenderURL}" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

Finally, we'll look at the `portlet:resourceURL` tag.

If the `var` attribute is present, the `portlet:resourceURL` tag introduces an
EL variable that contains a `javax.portlet.ActionURL`, adequate for obtaining
resources. Otherwise, the URL is written to the response. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <f:view xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
        xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:portlet="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0"
        xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets">
        <h:head />
        <h:body">
            <h:form>
                <portlet:resourceURL var="myResourceURL">
                    <portlet:param name="foo" value="1234" />
                </portlet:resourceURL>
                <h:outputText var="actionURL=#{myResourceURL}" />
            </h:form>
        </h:body>
    </f:view>

Now that we've introduced you to some of Liferay Faces Bridge's `UIComponent`
tags, let's explore how to dynamically add JSF portlets to portal pages. 

### Dynamically Adding JSF Portlets to Liferay Portal (Runtime Portlets) [](id=dynamically-add-jsf-portlets-to-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Portal lets you add portlets dynamically to portal pages using several
approaches: 

- Inside the FreeMarker template or [Velocity
  template](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Embedding+a+portlet+in+the+theme)
  of a theme with `$theme.runtime()` 
- Inside a [layout template](http://www.liferay.com/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Add+runtime+portlets+to+a+layout)
  with `$processor.processPortlet()` 
- Inside a JSP with `<liferay-portlet:runtime />` 

Unfortunately, as described in
[FACES-244](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/FACES-244), dynamically adding  JSF
portlets doesn't work very well. It's actually not limited to JSF portlets--
this problem happens with any portlet that needs to add JS/CSS resources to
the `<head>`...`</head>` section of the portal page. Since JSF portlets require
the `jsf.js` resource to perform Ajax requests, the `jsf.js` resource must be
loaded when the portal page is initially rendered. 

There are two workarounds:

1.  For plain JSF portlets, add a `<link />` element for the `jsf.js` resource
    in the `<head>`...`</head>` section of the `portal_normal.vm` or
    `portal_normal.ftl` file in the theme. The first few lines of `jsf.js`
    prevent double-instantiation in case it gets included multiple times on a
    page. This can occur when a JSF portlet is dynamically included and another
    JSF portlet is added statically. Unfortunately this approach doesn't work
    for PrimeFaces, since `primefaces.js` does not prevent double-instantiation.

2.  Use an IFrame: 

        <div id="${request.portlet-namespace}my_runtime_portlet">
            <script type="text/javascript">
                AUI().use('liferay-portlet-url', 'aui-resize-iframe', function(A) {
                var portletURL = Liferay.PortletURL.createRenderURL();
                portletURL.setPortletId('1_WAR_mypluginportlet');
                portletURL.setPlid(themeDisplay.getPlid());
                var html = '<iframe frameborder="0" id="${request.portlet-namespace}my_runtime_portlet_frame" src="' + portletURL.toString() + '" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe>';
                A.one('#${request.portlet-namespace}my_runtime_portlet').append(html);
                A.one('#${request.portlet-namespace}my_runtime_portlet_frame').plug(A.Plugin.ResizeIframe);
                });
            </script>
        </div>
 
In order to avoid the *You do not have the roles required to access this
portlet* error message, add the following directive to the
`WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml` descriptor: 

    <add-default-resource>true</add-default-resource>

Alternatively, you can place the portlet alone on a hidden portal page and
then use a portlet URL referring to the `plid` of the hidden portal page. This
approach is more appropriate for portlets that perform security-sensitive
actions. 

Note, when an end-user dynamically adds any JSF 2 portlet to a portal page, the
JSF 2 standard `jsf.js` JavaScript code is not automatically executed. In order
for the `jsf.js` to be executed, the page must be fully refreshed. 

As a workaround, Liferay Portal provides configuration parameters that allow the
developer to specify that a full page refresh is required. Specifying this
ensures that JSF 2 is properly initialized. You specify the required
`<render-weight>` and `<ajaxable>` parameter elements in the
`WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml` configuration file. 

    <liferay-portlet-app>
        <portlet>
            <portlet-name>my_portlet</portlet-name>
            <instanceable>false</instanceable>
            <render-weight>1</render-weight>
            <ajaxable>false</ajaxable>
        </portlet>
    </liferay-portlet-app>

Now, you know the options you have in dynamically adding your JSF portlets at
runtime. 

Next, we'll discuss extension of Liferay Faces Bridge with Factory Wrappers.

### Extending Liferay Faces Bridge Using Factory Wrappers [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-factory-wrappers-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

[Liferay Faces
Bridge](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/overview)
has several abstract classes that serve as contracts for defining factories: 

- [BridgeContextFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/context/BridgeContextFactory.java)
- [BridgePhaseFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/BridgePhaseFactory.java)
- [BridgeRequestScopeFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/scope/BridgeRequestScopeFactory.java)
- [BridgeRequestScopeFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/scope/BridgeRequestScopeFactory.java)
- [BridgeRequestScopeCacheFactory.java](https://github.com/liray/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/scope/BridgeRequestScopeCacheFactory.java)
- [BridgeRequestScopeCacheFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/scope/BridgeRequestScopeCacheFactory.java)
- [BridgeRequestScopeManagerFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/scope/BridgeRequestScopeManagerFactory.java)
- [BridgeWriteBehindSupportFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/application/view/BridgeWriteBehindSupportFactory.java)
- [BridgeURLFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/context/url/BridgeURLFactory.java)
- [IncongruityContextFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/context/IncongruityContextFactory.java)
- [PortletContainerFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/container/PortletContainerFactory.java)
- [PortletContainerFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/container/PortletContainerFactory.java)
- [UploadedFileFactory.java](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/model/UploadedFileFactory.java)

These factories are defined using the standard JSF `<factory-extension>` element
in `faces-config.xml`. The *default implementations* of these factories are
defined in the [bridge's `META-INF/faces-config.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/resources/META-INF/faces-config.xml)
file. 

The bridge features an *extension mechanism* that enables you to decorate
any of these factories using a `META-INF/faces-config.xml` descriptor (inside a
JAR), or a `WEB-INF/faces-config.xml` descriptor (inside a portlet WAR). This
mechanism enables you to plug in your own factory implementations to decorate
(wrap) the default implementations, using a
[`FactoryWrapper`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/FactoryWrapper.java). 

<!-- Missing transition. -Rich --> 

#### Wrapping the BridgeContextFactory with a Custom BridgeContext [](id=wrap-bridgecontextfactory-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

This *tutorial* for [Liferay Faces Bridge](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/overview)
shows you how to wrap the
[`BridgeContextFactory`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/context/BridgeContextFactory.java)
class, so that it returns a custom
[`BridgeContext`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/bridge-impl/src/main/java/com/liferay/faces/bridge/context/BridgeContext.java)
instance by overriding one of the methods to provide custom functionality.  

1.  Create a wrapper class for the `BridgeContext` that overrides the
    `getResponseNamespace()` method: 

        package com.mycompany.myproject;

        public class BridgeContextCustomImpl extends BridgeContextWrapper {

            private BridgeContext wrappedBridgeContext;

            public BridgeContextCustomImpl(BridgeContext bridgeContext) {

                this.wrappedBridgeContext = bridgeContext;
                BridgeContext.setCurrentInstance(this);
            }

            @Override
            public String getResponseNamespace() {
                // return value based on custom algorithm.
            }

            @Override
            public BridgeContext getWrapped() {
                return wrappedBridgeContext;
            }
        }

2.  Create a wrapper class for the `BridgeContextFactory`: 

        package com.mycompany.myproject;

        public class BridgeContextFactoryCustomImpl extends BridgeContextFactory {

            private BridgeContextFactory wrappedBridgeContextFactory;

            public BridgeContextFactoryCustomImpl(
                BridgeContextFactory bridgeContextFactory) {

               this.wrappedBridgeContextFactory =  bridgeContextFactory;
            }

            public BridgeContextFactory getWrapped() {
                return wrappedBridgeContextFactory;
            }

            @Override
            public BridgeContext getBridgeContext(
                BridgeConfig bridgeConfig, BridgeRequestScope bridgeRequestScope,
                PortletConfig portletConfig, PortletContext portletContext,
                PortletRequest portletRequest, PortletResponse portletResponse,
                Bridge.PortletPhase portletPhase, PortletContainer portletContainer,
                IncongruityContext incongruityContext) {

                BridgeContext wrappedBridgeContext =
                wrappedBridgeContextFactory.getBridgeContext(
                    bridgeConfig, bridgeRequestScope, portletConfig, portletContext,
                    portletRequest, portletResponse, portletPhase, portletContainer,
                    incongruityContext);

                BridgeContext bridgeContext =
                    new BridgeContextCustomImpl(wrappedBridgeContext);

                return bridgeContext;
            }
        }

3.  In the portlet's `WEB-INF/faces-config.xml`, specify the custom factory: 

        <faces-config xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
        xmlns:bridge="http://www.liferay.com/xml/ns/liferay-faces-bridge-2.0-extension"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" version="2.0"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee 
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd">
            <factory>
                <factory-extension>
                    <bridge:bridge-context-factory>
                        com.mycompany.myproject.BridgeContextFactoryCustomImpl
                    </bridge:bridge-context-factory>
                </factory-extension>
            </factory>
        </faces-config>

4.  Rebuild and re-deploy the portlet. 

That's all you need to do to implement and deploy a `BridgeContextFactory`
wrapper. 

Next, we'll take a detailed look at how Liferay Faces Bridge satisfies the
portlet bridge specifications and at some of the bridge's configuration options.

## Understanding Liferay Faces Bridge [](id=liferay-faces-bridge-details-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge is a JAR that you can add as a dependency to
your portlet WAR projects, in order to deploy JSF web applications as portlets
within JSR 286 (Portlet 2.0) compliant portlet containers, like Liferay Portal
5.2, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2. 

The Liferay Faces Bridge project home page can be found at
<http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/bridge>. 

To fully understand Liferay Faces Bridge, you must first understand the
portlet bridge standard.  Because the Portlet 1.0 and JSF 1.0 specs were being
created at essentially the same time, the Expert Group (EG) for the JSF
specification constructed the JSF framework to be compliant with portlets. For
example, the
[ExternalContext.getRequest()](http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/faces/context/ExternalContext.html)
method returns an `Object` instead of an
[javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest](http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html).
When this method is used in a portal, the `Object` can be cast to a
[javax.portlet.PortletRequest](http://portals.apache.org/pluto/portlet-2.0-apidocs/javax/portlet/PortletRequest.html).
Despite the EG's consciousness of portlet compatibility within the design of
JSF, the gap between the portlet and JSF lifecycles had to be bridged. 

Portlet bridge standards and implementations evolved over time. 

Starting in 2004, several different JSF portlet bridge implementations were
developed in order to provide JSF developers with the ability to deploy their
JSF web apps as portlets. In 2006, the JCP formed the Portlet Bridge 1.0 ([JSR 301](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=301)) 
EG in order to define a standard bridge API, as well as detailed requirements
for bridge implementations. JSR 301 was released in 2010, targeting Portlet 1.0
and JSF 1.2. 

When the Portlet 2.0 ([JSR 286](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286))
standard was released in 2008, it became necessary for the JCP to form the
Portlet Bridge 2.0 ([JSR 329](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=329)) EG. JSR
329 was also released in 2010, targeting Portlet 2.0 and JSF 1.2. 

After the [JSR 314](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314) EG released JSF 2.0
in 2009 and JSF 2.1 in 2010, it became evident that a Portlet Bridge 3.0
standard would be beneficial. At the time of this writing, the JCP has not
formed such an EG. In the meantime, Liferay developed *Liferay Faces Bridge*,
which targets Portlet 2.0 and JSF 1.2/2.1/2.2. 

<!-- The "At the time of this writing ..." text should probably be reworded.
I'll need to consult Neil as to whether an EG ever formed. - Jim --> 

Liferay Faces Bridge is an implementation of the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge
Standard. It also contains innovative features that make it possible to leverage
the power of JSF 2.x inside a portlet application. 

Now that you're familiar with some of the history of the Portlet Bridge
standards, let's consider the responsibilities required of the portlet
bridge. 

A JSF portlet bridge aligns the correct phases of the JSF lifecycle with each
phase of the portlet lifecycle. For instance, if a browser sends an HTTP GET
request to a portal page with a JSF portlet in it, the `RENDER_PHASE` is
perfomed in the portlet's lifecycle. The JSF portlet bridge then initiates the
`RESTORE_VIEW` and `RENDER_RESPONSE` phases in the JSF lifecycle. Likewise, when
an HTTP POST is executed on a portlet and the portlet enters the `ACTION_PHASE`,
then the full JSF lifecycle is initiated by the bridge. 

![Figure 4.3: The different phases of the JSF Lifecycle are executed depending on which phase of the Portlet lifecycle is being executed.](../../images/04-lifecycle-bridge.png)
 
Besides ensuring that the two lifecycles connect correctly, the JSF portlet
bridge also acts as a mediator between the portal URL generator and JSF
navigation rules. JSF portlet bridges ensure that URLs created by the
portal comply with JSF navigation rules, so that a JSF portlet is able to
switch to different views. 

With the main aspects of JSF portlet bridges described, let's discuss the
configuration of Liferay Faces Bridge. 

### Configuring Liferay Faces Bridge [](id=configure-liferay-faces-bridge-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The JSR 329 standard defines several configuration options prefixed with the
`javax.portlet.faces` namespace. Liferay Faces Bridge defines additional
implementation-specific options prefixed with the `com.liferay.faces.bridge`
namespace. 

Let's consider configuring the Bridge Request Scope behavior first. 

#### Configuring Bridge Request Scope Behavior [](id=configure-bridge-request-scope-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

One of the key requirements in creating a JSF portlet bridge is managing JSF
request-scoped data within the portlet lifecycle. This is normally referred to
as the *Bridge Request Scope* by JSR 329. The lifespan of the Bridge Request
Scope works like this: 

1.  `ActionRequest`/`EventRequest`: `BridgeRequestScope` begins.

2.  `RenderRequest`: `BridgeRequestScope` is preserved.

3.  Subsequent `RenderRequest`: `BridgeRequestScope` is reused.

4.  Subsequent `ActionRequest`/`EventRequest`: `BridgeRequestScope` ends, and a
    new `BridgeRequestScope` begins.

5.  If the session expires or is invalidated, then similar to the
    `PortletSession` scope, all `BridgeRequestScope` instances associated with
    the session are made available for garbage collection by the JVM.

The main use-case for having the `BridgeRequestScope` preserved in Step 2
(above) is for *re-rendering* portlets. Let's consider an example to help
illustrate this use-case. 

Let's say two or more JSF portlets are placed on a portal page (Portlets X and
Y), and those portlets are *not* using `f:ajax` for form submission. In such a
case, if the user were to submit a form (via full `ActionRequest` postback) in
Portlet X, and then submit a form in Portlet Y, then Portlet X should be
re-rendered with its previously submitted form data. 

With the advent of JSF 2.x and Ajax, there were four drawbacks for continuing
to support this use-case as the default behavior: 

-   Request-scoped data is basically semi-session-scoped in nature, because the
    `BridgeRequestScope` is preserved (even though the user might NEVER click
    the Submit button again). 
-   `BridgeRequestScope` can't be stored in the `PortletSession` because the
    data is request-scoped in nature, and the data stored in the scope isn't
    guaranteed to be `Serializable` for replication. Therefore, it doesn't
    really work well in a clustered deployment. 
-   The developer might have to specify the
    `javax.portlet.faces.MAX_MANAGED_REQUEST_SCOPES` `<init-param>` in the
    `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor in order to tune the memory settings on the
    server. 

As result, Liferay Faces Bridge was designed for JSF 2.x, and keeps Ajax in
mind. The Liferay Faces Bridge makes the following assumptions: 

-   Developers are not primarily concerned about the *re-rendering of
    portlets* use-case mentioned above. 
-   Developers don't want any of the drawbacks mentioned above. 
-   Developers are making heavy use of the `f:ajax` tag and submitting
    forms via Ajax with their modern-day portlets. 
-   Developers want to do as little configuration as possible and don't
    want to be forced to add anything to the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor. 

Consequently, the default behavior of Liferay Faces Bridge is to cause the
`BridgeRequestScope` to end at the end of the `RenderRequest`.

If you prefer the standard behavior over Liferay Faces Bridge's default
behavior, then you can place the following option in your portlet's
`WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor: 

    <!--
    The default value of the following context-param is false, meaning that
    Liferay Faces Bridge will cause the BridgeRequestScope to end after the
    RENDER_PHASE of the portlet lifecycle. Setting the value to true will cause
    Liferay Faces Bridge to cause the BridgeRequestScope to last until the next
    ACTION_PHASE or EVENT_PHASE of the portlet lifecycle.
    -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.bridgeRequestScopePreserved</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <!--
    The default value of the following context-param is 100. It defines the
    maximum number of BridgeRequestScope instances to keep in memory on the
    server if the bridgeRequestScopePreserved option is true. 
    -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>javax.portlet.faces.MAX_MANAGED_REQUEST_SCOPES</param-name>
        <param-value>2000</param-value>
    </context-param>

Alternatively, the `com.liferay.faces.bridge.bridgeRequestScopePreserved` value
can be specified on a portlet-by-portlet basis in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml`
descriptor.

#### Using PreDestroy and BridgePreDestroy Annotations [](id=predestroy-bridgepredestroy-annotations-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

When JSF developers want to perform cleanup on managed-beans before they are
destroyed, they typically annotate a method inside the bean with the
`@PreDestroy` annotation. However, section 6.8.1 of the JSR 329 standard
discusses the need for the `@BridgePreDestroy` and
`@BridgeRequestScopeAttributeAdded`  annotations in the bridge API. 

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** For an in-depth discussion of this
 issue, please refer to <http://issues.liferay.com/browse/FACES-146>. 

---

In order to explain this requirement, it is necessary to make a distinction
between *local* portals and *remote* portals. Local portals invoke portlets that
are deployed in the same (local) portlet container. Remote portals invoke
portlets that are deployed elsewhere via WSRP (Web Services for Remote
Portlets). The `@BridgePreDestroy` and `@BridgeRequestScopeAttributeAdded`
annotations were introduced into the JSR 329 standard primarily to support WSRP
in remote portals. That being the case, the standard indicates that developers
should always use `@BridgePreDestroy` instead of `@PreDestroy`. Liferay Faces
Bridge however takes a different approach: rather than assuming the remote
portal use-case, Liferay Faces Bridge assumes the local portal use-case. When
developing with a local portal like Liferay, Liferay Faces Bridge ensures that
the standard `@PreDestroy` annotation works as expected. This means there is no
reason to use the `@BridgeRequestScope` annotation with a local portal when
using Liferay Faces Bridge. Developers must manually configure Liferay Faces
Bridge via the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor in order to leverage the
`@BridgePreDestroy` and `@BridgeRequestScopeAttributeAdded` annotations for
WSRP. 

    <!--
    The default value of the following context-param is false, meaning that
    Liferay Faces Bridge will invoke methods annotated with @PreDestroy over
    those annoated with @BridgePreDestroy. Setting the value of the following
    context-param instructs Liferay Faces Bridge to prefer the @BridgePreDestroy
    annotation over the standard @PreDestroy annotation in order to support a
    WSRP remote portal environment.
    -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.preferPreDestroy</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <!--
    The following listener is required to support the
    @BridgeRequestScopeAttributeAdded annotation in a WSRP remote portal
    environment. 
    -->
    <listener>
        <listener-class>com.liferay.faces.bridge.servlet.BridgeRequestAttributeListener</listener-class>
    </listener>

Alternatively, the `com.liferay.faces.bridge.preferPreDestroy` value can be
specified on a portlet-by-portlet basis in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor.

<!-- Missing transition. -Rich -->

#### Configuring the Portlet Container Abilities [](id=configure-portlet-container-abilities-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge can be run in a variety of portlet containers (Liferay,
Pluto, etc.) and is aware of some of the abilities (or limitations) of these
containers. Liferay Faces Bridge enables you to configure the abilities of the
portlet container in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor. 

    <!--
    The default value of the following context-param depends on which portlet
    container the bridge is running in. The value determines whether or not the
    bridge resource handler will attempt to set the status code of downloaded
    resources to values like HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_MODIFIED.
    -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.containerAbleToSetHttpStatusCode</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

By configuring portlet container capabilities, you can take advantage of your
portlet container's specific strengths while using Liferay Faces Bridge. 

#### Configuring Portlet Namespace Optimization [](id=configure-portlet-namespace-optimization-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The JSR 329 standard requires the bridge implementation to prepend the portlet
namespace to every JSF view component's `id` attribute. This distinguishes the
component when there are multiple JSF portlets on a portal page that contain
similar component hierarchies and naming.  Also, the JSR 329 standard indicates
that the bridge implementation of the `ExternalContext.encodeNamesapce(String)`
method is to prepend the value of `javax.portlet.PortletResponse.getNamespace()`
to the specified `String`. The problem is that since the value returned by
`getNamespace()` can be a lengthy `String`, the size of the rendered HTML portal
page can become unnecessarily large. This can be especially non-performant when
using the `f:ajax` tag in a Facelet view to perform partial-updates to the
browser's DOM. 

Liferay Faces Bridge has a built-in optimization that minimizes the value
returned by the `ExternalContext.encodeNamesapce(String)` method, while
still guaranteeing uniqueness.

If you don't want to leverage the namespace optimization and instead want to
leverage the default behavior specified by JSR 329, you must set this value to
`false` in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor: 

    <!--
    The default value of the following context-param is true, meaning that
    Liferay Faces Bridge will optimize the portlet namespace. Setting the value
    of the following context-param to false disables the optimization.
    -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.optimizePortletNamespace</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </context-param>

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Due to strict namespacing requirements
 introduced in Liferay Portal 6.2, the namespace optimization feature only works
 in Liferay Portal 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1. 

---

#### Configuring XML Entity Validation [](id=validate-faces-config-xml-entities-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

<!-- Explain why this is helpful. - Jim -->

Liferay Faces Bridge gives you the option of enabling or disabling XML
validation for all `faces-config.xml` file entities. By default, the validation
is disabled. 

To enable XML validation for all `faces-config.xml` file entities,
you can set the option to `true` in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor: 

    <!-- The default value of the following context-param is false. -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.resolveXMLEntities</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

<!-- Don't end a section with a code block. -Rich -->

#### Configuring Resource Buffer Size [](id=configure-resource-buffer-size-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Liferay Faces Bridge lets you set the size of the buffer used to load resources
into memory as file contents are copied to the response. The default value of
this option is `1024` (1KB). 

<!-- Is the code below from a web.xml? - Jim -->

    <!-- The default value of the following context-param is 1024. -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.resourceBufferSize</param-name>
        <param-value>4096</param-value>
    </context-param>

Alternatively, you can specify the `com.liferay.faces.bridge.resourceBufferSize`
value on a portlet-by-portlet basis in the `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptor. 

#### Configuring Distinct Request Scoped Managed Beans [](id=distinct-request-scoped-managed-beans-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Portal gives you the ability to specify whether or not
request attributes are shared among portlets, using the
`<private-request-attributes>` option in the `WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml`
descriptor. The default value of this option is `true`, meaning that request
attributes are NOT shared among portlets. 

    <liferay-portlet-app>
        <portlet>

            ...

            <private-request-attributes>false</private-request-attributes>
        </portlet>

        ...

    </liferay-portlet-app>

However, this non-shared feature only works for request attributes that are
present in the request map and that have a non-null value. This can cause a
problem for JSF managed-beans in request scope. Specifically, the problem arises
when a portal page has two or more portlets that have a request scope managed
bean with the same name.

For example, say Portlet X and Portlet Y each have a
class named `BackingBean` annotated with `@RequestScoped` `@ManagedBean`. When
the JSF runtime is asked to resolve an EL-expression `#{backingBean}`, there is
no guarantee that the correct instance will be resolved. In order to solve this
problem, Liferay Faces Bridge provides a configuration option that can be
specified in `WEB-INF/web.xml`. It causes request-scoped managed beans to be
distinct for each portlet. 

    <!-- The default value of the following context-param is false. -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.distinctRequestScopedManagedBeans</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

To ensure that `@RequestScoped` managed beans are resolved correctly for each
portlet, set this value to `true`. 

#### Configuring View Parameters [](id=configure-view-parameters-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

In the case of a portlet `RenderRequest`, Section 5.2.6 of the JSR 329 Spec
requires that the bridge ensure that only the `RESTORE_VIEW` and
`RENDER_RESPONSE` phases of the JSF lifecycle execute. In addition, Section 6.4
requires that a `PhaseListener` be used to skip the `APPLY_REQUEST_VALUES`,
`PROCESS_VALIDATIONS`, `UPDATE_MODEL_VALUES`, and `INVOKE_APPLICATION` phases.
These requirements are valid for JSF 1.x, but for JSF 2.x *View Parameters*, the
presence of `f:metadata` and `f:viewParam` in a Facelet view, makes the
entire JSF lifecycle run. 

Liferay Faces Bridge enables support for View Parameters by default, but
provides a configuration option in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor that lets
you disable the feature. 

    <!-- The default value of the following context-param is true. -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.bridge.viewParametersEnabled</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </context-param>

If it is necessary to use the JSF 1.x version of this feature, then this
parameter should be set to `false`. 

Now that we've discussed JSF portlet bridge standards and Liferay Faces Bridge
configuration options, let's learn how Liferay Faces Portal lets you leverage
Liferay Portal's utilities and component tags. 

## Leveraging Liferay Utilities with Liferay Faces Portal [](id=leveraging-liferay-utilities-with-lifera-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Let's first consider the Liferay Portal utilities available for you to use with
your JSF portlets. 

Since you're integrating your JSF portlet with Liferay Portal, you'll want to
know how to access different parts of Liferay's development framework. In this
section, we'll show you some of the key aspects of Liferay Portal that you can
access via Liferay Faces Portal. 

<!-- All of the sections below need further fleshing out, with code block
examples. -Rich -->

### Using the LiferayFacesContext [](id=liferay-faces-portal-liferayfacescontext-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

`LiferayFacesContext` is an abstract class that extends the JSF
[FacesContext](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/api/javax/faces/context/FacesContext.html)
abstract class. Because of this, it supplies all the same method signatures. The
`LiferayFacesContext` implements the [delegation design
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) for methods defined by
[FacesContext](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/api/javax/faces/context/FacesContext.html)
by first calling 
[FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/api/javax/faces/context/FacesContext.html#getCurrentInstance())
and then delegating to corresponding methods. 

<!-- We need to get Liferay Faces HTML Javadoc generated and posted on
docs.liferay.com so that we can provide links to it for classes like
LiferayFacesContext. - Jim --> 

### Leveraging the Current Theme [](id=current-theme-in-jsf-liferay-faces-portal-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Portal offers several features to help you access and use the
current Liferay theme. 

Liferay Faces Portal provides the `LiferayFacesContext.getThemeDisplay()` method
at the Java level and the `liferay.themeDisplay` EL variable at the Facelet
level, for accessing the Liferay
[`ThemeDisplay`](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/portal-service/com/liferay/portal/theme/ThemeDisplay.html)
object. 

Liferay Faces Portal provides the `liferay-ui:icon` Facelet composite component
tag that encapsulates an HTML `img` tag whose `src` attribute contains a fully
qualified URL to an icon image in the current Liferay theme. Additionally,
Liferay Faces Portal provides the `liferay.themeImagesURL` and
`liferay.themeImageURL` Facelet composite component tags for gaining access to
theme image icons. 

### Giving Feedback to Users with Validation Messages [](id=liferay-faces-portal-validation-messages-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Most of the standard JSF HTML component tags render themselves as HTML markup
such as `<label />`, `<input />`, `<span />`, etc. and assume the current
Liferay theme thanks to the power of CSS. However, the
[`h:messages`](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/tlddocs/h/messages.html)
and
[`h:message`](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/tlddocs/h/message.html)
tag will not assume the current Liferay theme unless the following JSR 286
standard CSS class names `portlet-msg-error`, `portlet-msg-info`, and
`portlet-msg-warn` are applied: 

        <h:messages errorClass="portlet-msg-error" fatalClass="portlet-msg-error" infoClass="portlet-msg-info" warnClass="portlet-msg-warn" /> 

<!-- Demonstrate using the liferay-ui:message tag for these message types.  - Jim -->

As a convenience, Liferay Faces Portal provides the
[`liferay-ui:message`](http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/liferay-ui/message.html)
Facelet composite component tag that encapsulates the
[`h:message`](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/tlddocs/h/message.html)
tag. The `liferay-ui:message` tag automatically applies the JSR 286 standard
class names, as shown above. 

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** When running as a portlet, the ICEfaces
 [`ice:messages`](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/latest/tld/ice/messages.html) and
 [`ice:message`](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/latest/tld/ice/message.html)
 component tags automatically apply the JSR 286 standard class names too.
 Additionally, the 
 [`ice:dataTable`](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/latest/tld/ice/dataTable.html)
 component tag applies the following JSR 286 standard class names for
 alternating table rows: 

 - `portlet-section-alternate`
 - `portlet-section-body`

---

Next, we'll look at using Liferay Faces Portal's language capabilities
with JSF Portlets. 

### Leveraging the Portal User's Locale [](id=liferay-faces-portal-liferay-locale-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

By default, the
[Locale](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html) that is
normally used to present internationalized JSF views is based on the
web-browser's locale settings. In order to use the portal user's language
preference, Liferay Faces Portal automatically registers the
`LiferayLocalePhaseListener`. This phase listener modifies the locale inside the
[UIViewRoot](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2ee/javaee/javaserverfaces/2.0/docs/api/javax/faces/component/UIViewRoot.html),
based on the user's language preference returned by the
[User.getLocale()](http://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/javadocs/portal-service/com/liferay/portal/model/User.html#getLocale())
method. 

Now that you're familiar with some of the key utilities that you can access
through Liferay Faces Portal, let's look at the UIComponent and composite
component tags that you can leverage through Liferay Faces Portal. 

## Using Liferay Portal UIComponent and Composite Component-Tags [](id=uicomponent-and-composite-component-tags-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Liferay Faces Portal provides a set of Facelet UIComponent and Facelet Composite
Component tags as part of its component suite. 

Because Liferay Faces has several [active versions](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en) (targeting different versions of JSF, Liferay Portal, etc.), there are several versions of the project's View Declaration Language (VDL) documentation for these tags. The VDL documentation can be found at the following addresses: 

- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>. 

<!-- Re-add upon release. - Jim
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 4.1 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 4.2 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>.
-->

Liferay Faces Portal provides the following UIComponent tags under the
`liferay-ui` and `liferay-security` tags. 

<!-- Explain that we'll demonstrate how to use one of the tags as an example.
Eventually we'll add more demonstrations. - Jim -->

### The liferay-ui:input-editor tag [](id=liferay-ui-input-editor-tag-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

<!-- Note, that this tag is simply an example of one of the tags from liferay-ui
library. - Jim -->

The `liferay-ui:input-editor` tag renders a text area that lets you enter rich
text such as bold, italic, and underline. The renderer relies on the
[CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/)&#8482; to provide the rich text editing area.
Since Liferay bundles the [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/)&#8482; JavaScript and
related images with the portal, the portlet developer does not need to include
it with  the portlet. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <f:view xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:liferay-ui="xmlns:liferay-ui="http://liferay.com/faces/ui">

        <h:form>
            <liferay-ui:input-editor id="comments" value="#{modelManagedBean.comments}" />
        </h:form>

    </f:view>

---

![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Prior to Liferay 6.0 SP2 (6.0.12), the
rich text area was rendered as an `<iframe>`. But due to incompatibilities with
IE, the rich text area HTML markup is now  rendered inline with the portal
page. Liferay Faces Portal automatically detects the version of Liferay and
renders the rich text area accordingly. However, if you are using Liferay 6.0
(6.0.10) or Liferay 6.0 SP1 (6.0.11) and have received an inline patch from
Liferay Support, then you'll need to add the following context parameter to the
portlet's `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor: 

    <context-param>
        <param-name>com.liferay.faces.portal.inlineInputEditor</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </context-param>

If you're using ICEfaces, then the inline version of `liferay-ui:input-editor`
exposes an inefficiency in the Direct2DOM&#8482; (DOM-diff) algorithm. Typing a
single character in the rich text area causes ICEfaces to detect a DOM-diff,
causing the entire `liferay-ui:input-editor` to be replaced in the browser's DOM
when the form is submitted via Ajax. To workaround this problem, use
the JSF 2.x `f:ajax` component to optimize/control which parts of the JSF
component tree are DOM-diffed by ICEfaces. For example, you could apply the
`f:ajax` component like this: 

    <h:panelGroup id="feedback">
        <h:messages globalOnly="true" layout="table" />
    </h:panelGroup>
    <h:panelGroup id="editor">
        <liferay-ui:input-editor value="#{modelBean.text}" />
    </h:panelGroup>
    <h:commandButton>
        <f:ajax execute="@form" render="feedback" />
    </h:commandButton>
                     
---

Next, we'll look at the `liferay-ui` prefixed composite component tags.

## Using Liferay Composite Component Tags [](id=liferay-faces-portal-composite-tags-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

<!-- Explain that we'll demonstrate how to use several of the tags. - Jim -->

<!-- Need some introduction here. What are these tags, what makes them different
from the previous type of tags? Etc. -Rich -->

### The liferay-ui:ice-info-data-paginator tag [](id=liferay-ui-ice-info-data-paginator-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The `liferay-ui:ice-info-data-paginator` encapsulates an ICEfaces 3.1
[`ice:dataPaginator`](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/v1_8_1/tld/ice/dataPaginator.html)
tag that renders pagination information for an associated
[`ice:dataTable`](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/v1_8_1/tld/ice/dataTable.html).
The navigation information matches the internationalized Liferay
"showing-x-x-of-x-results" message. Since ICEfaces 4.0 removed support for
`ice:dataPaginator`, Liferay Faces 4.x no longer includes this feature. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

        <ice:dataTable id="dataTable1" value="#{modelManagedBean.rows}" var="row">
            ...
        </ice:dataTable>

    </f:view>
 
Next, we'll look at the `liferay-ui:ice-nav-data-paginator` composite component
tag. 

### The liferay-ui:ice-nav-data-paginator tag [](id=liferay-ui-ice-nav-data-paginator-tag-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The `liferay-ui:ice-info-data-paginator` encapsulates an ICEfaces 3.1
[ice:dataPaginator](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/v1_8_1/tld/ice/dataPaginator.html)
tag that renders navigation controls for an associated
[ice:dataTable](http://www.icefaces.org/docs/v1_8_1/tld/ice/dataTable.html). The
icons match the current Liferay theme. Since ICEfaces 4.0 has removed
support for ice:dataPaginator, Liferay Faces 4.x no longer includes this
feature. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <f:view xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"

        xmlns:liferay-ui="http://liferay.com/faces/ui">

        <liferay-ui:ice-nav-data-paginator for="dataTable1" />
        <ice:dataTable id="dataTable1" value="#{modelManagedBean.rows}" var="row">
            ...
        </ice:dataTable>

    </f:view>

Next, we'll look at the `liferay-ui:icon` composite component tag.

### The liferay-ui:icon tag [](id=liferay-ui-icon-tag-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

The `liferay-ui:icon` tag encapsulates an HTML `img` tag whose `src` attribute
contains a fully qualified URL to an icon image in the current Liferay theme. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <f:view xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:ice="http://www.icesoft.com/icefaces/component"
        xmlns:liferay-ui="http://liferay.com/faces/ui">

        <liferay-ui:icon alt="#{i18n['delete']}" image="delete" />

    </f:view>

Next, we'll look at the `liferay-security` prefixed tags.

### The liferay-security:permissionsURL tag [](id=liferay-security-permissionsurl-tag-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The `liferay-security:permissionsURL` tag renders an HTML anchor tag (hyperlink)
to the Liferay Permissions screen for the associated resource. 

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <f:view xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core"
        xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
        xmlns:liferay-security="xmlns:liferay-ui="http://liferay.com/faces/security">

        <h:form>
            <liferay-security:permissionsURL
                modelResource="myproject.model.Book"
                modelResourceDescription="Book"
                resourcePrimKey="#{modelManagedBean.book.bookId} />
        </h:form>

    </f:view>

Now that we have discussed the `LiferayFacesContext`, Liferay Faces Portal theme
integration, and Liferay language integration, let's learn what UI components
are available to use from Liferay Faces Alloy. 

## Leveraging AlloyUI Components with Liferay Faces Alloy [](id=liferay-faces-alloy-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

<!-- This section needs to be expanded. First, the reader needs some insight as
to what AlloyUI is and why they'd want to use it. Then, eventually, we need to
demonstrate using AlloyUI in a JSF portlet. - Jim --> 

Liferay Faces Alloy is a `.jar` file that you add as a dependency in your
JSF portlet project to leverage [AlloyUI](http://alloyui.com/). Liferay Faces
Alloy provides a way to use AlloyUI in a typical JSF development fashion. It
provides a set of Facelet UIComponent and Facelet Composite
Component tags as part of its component suite. 

The Liferay Faces Alloy project home page can be found at
<http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/alloy>. 

Because Liferay Faces has several [active versions](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
(targeting different versions of JSF, Liferay Portal, etc.), there are several
versions of the project's View Declaration Language (VDL) documentation for
these tags. The VDL documentation can be found at the following addresses: 

- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>. 

<!-- Re-add links to VDLs for versions 4.1 and 4.2 when they are released. - Jim
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.1 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.2 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>.
-->

To see a sample JSF porlet that uses Liferay Faces Alloy, check out the
[JSF2 Registration Portlet](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/tree/3.1.3-ga4/demos/portal/jsf2-registration-portlet). 

Next, let's get a handle on the versioning scheme used for Liferay Faces. 

## Understanding the Liferay Faces Version Scheme [](id=liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

[Liferay Faces](http://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-faces/overview)
follows a `Major1.Major2.Minor-Type` versioning scheme:

`Major1`: 

- `1` = Portlet 1.0 Bridge for JSF 1.2 (JSR 301) *(Note that Liferay Faces
does not support Portlet 1.0)* 
- `2` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 1.2 (JSR 329) 
- `3` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 2.1 (JSR TBA) 
- `4` = Portlet 2.0 Bridge for JSF 2.2 (JSR TBA) 

`Major2`: 

- `0-legacy` = Liferay `5.2`
- `0` = Liferay `6.0` 
- `1` = Liferay `6.1` 
- `2` = Liferay `6.2` 

`Minor`: 

- May contain bug fixes, improvements, and new features. 

`Type`: 

- GA (General Availability) 
- RC (Release Candidate) 
- BETA (Beta Quality) 
- ALPHA (Alpha Quality)

*Examples*:

- `3.1.0-ga1`: First GA release for JSF 2.0/2.1 for use with Liferay 6.1.x
- `3.1.1-ga2`: Second GA release for JSF 2.0/2.1 for use with Liferay 6.1.x
 
---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** Some permutations of this
 versioning scheme are not supported, see table below for specific information
 on supported versions of JSF and Liferay Portal. 

---

The following table displays the Liferay Faces version and its compatible
Liferay Portal version and its compatible JSF version:

| Liferay Faces Version | JSF Version (`Major1`) | Liferay Portal Version (`Major2`) |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `2.1.x`               | `1.2`                  | `6.1`                             |
| `3.0.x-legacy`        | `2.1`                  | `5.2`                             |
| `3.0.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.0`                             |
| `3.1.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.1`                             | 
| `3.2.x`               | `2.1`                  | `6.2`                             |
| `4.1.x`               | `2.2`                  | `6.1`                             | 
| `4.2.x` (master)      | `2.2`                  | `6.2`                             |

While Liferay Faces Bridge is theoretically compatible with any portal that
implements the Portlet 2.0 standard, it has been carefully tested for use with
Liferay Portal versions 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 and has several optimizations
that provide increased performance on Liferay. 

If you've developed portlets that use the PortletFaces Bridge, you'll need to
migrate them to Liferay Faces in order to deploy them using the Liferay Faces
Bridge--don't worry, it's very straightforward. In the next section, we'll show
you how easy it is to migrate to Liferay Faces. 

## Migrating to Liferay Faces [](id=migrate-to-liferay-faces-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The Liferay Faces project originated from the <http://portletfaces.org>
community website. On April 3, 2012 Liferay announced that it would be assuming
leadership for the portletfaces.org community. Consequently, projects at
portletfaces.org were repackaged under the Liferay Faces umbrella project and
underwent the following name changes: 

- AlloyFaces &rarr; Liferay Faces Alloy 
- PorltetFaces Bridge &rarr; Liferay Faces Bridge 
- LiferayFaces &rarr; Liferay Faces Portal 

Throughout this section, we'll cover the various replacements for old classes
and namespaces. 

### Migrating BridgeRequestAttributeListener [](id=migrate-to-bridgerequestattributelistener-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

PortletFaces Bridge provided a class named
`org.portletfaces.bridge.servlet.BridgeRequestAttributeListener` but Liferay
Faces Bridge uses
`com.liferay.faces.bridge.servlet.BridgeRequestAttributeListener`. In order to
migrate to the new class, you will need to refactor to the new package
namespace, as a deprecated class has not been provided. 

<!--
Mention this is from `WEB-INF/web.xml`.
Modify code to possibly leave out the <web-app> tag.
Clarify that we're replacing the PortletFaces one with Liferay Faces Bridge one.
- Jim
-->

    <!-- PortletFaces Bridge BridgeRequestAttributeListener -->
    <web-app>
        <listener>
            ...
            <listener-class>
                org.portletfaces.bridge.servlet.BridgeRequestAttributeListener
            </listener-class>
            ...
        </listener>
    </web-app>

    <!-- Liferay Faces Bridge GenericFacesPortlet -->
    <web-app>
        <listener>
            ...
            <listener-class>
                com.liferay.faces.bridge.servlet.BridgeRequestAttributeListener
            </listener-class>
            ...
        </listener>
    </web-app>

Next, we'll look at the migration of configuration option names. 

### Migrating Configuration Option Names [](id=liferay-faces-configuration-option-names-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

PortletFaces Bridge provided several configuration options for use within the
`WEB-INF/web.xml` and `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` descriptors. In order to ease
migration, the configuration option names have been reproduced in the Liferay
Faces project. It is recommended that the new configuration option names be
used, as shown in the following listing: 

- `org.portletfaces.bridge.containerAbleToSetHttpStatusCode` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.containerAbleToSetHttpStatusCode` 

- `org.portletfaces.bridgeRequestScopePreserved` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.bridgeRequestScopePreserved`

- `org.portletfaces.bridge.optimizePortletNamespace` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.optimizePortletNamespace`

- `org.portletfaces.bridge.preferPreDestroy` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.preferPreDestroy`

- `org.portletfaces.bridge.resolveXMLEntities` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.resolveXMLEntities`

- `org.portletfaces.bridge.resourceBufferSize` &rarr;
  `com.liferay.faces.bridge.resourceBufferSize`

Next, we'll explain how file upload classes have changed between the PortletFaces
Bridge and the Liferay Faces Bridge. 

### Migrating File Upload [](id=migrate-liferay-faces-file-upload-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

PortletFaces Bridge provided classes named
`org.portletfaces.bridge.component.HtmlInputFile` and
`org.portletfaces.bridge.component.UploadedFile`, but Liferay Faces Bridge uses
`com.liferay.faces.bridge.component.HtmlInputFile` and
`com.liferay.faces.bridge.component.UploadedFile`, respectively. In order to
migrate to the new classes, you will need to refactor to the new package
namespace, as deprecated classes have not been provided. 

    // PortletFaces Bridge package name:
    import org.portletfaces.bridge.component.HtmlInputFile;

    // Liferay Faces Bridge package name:
    import com.liferay.faces.bridge.component.HtmlInputFile;

    // PortletFaces Bridge package name:
    import org.portletfaces.bridge.component.UploadedFile;

    // Liferay Faces Bridge package name:
    import com.liferay.faces.bridge.component.UploadedFile;
 
Next, we'll look at migrating Facelet Tags to Liferay Faces.

### Migrating Facelet Tag Library Namespaces [](id=migrate-facelet-tag-library-namespaces-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The projects at portletfaces.org provided several UIComponents and Composite
Components for use within Facelet views. The tag library documentation for these
components has been migrated to VDL documentation for each version of the
Liferay Faces Bridge: 

- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 2.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/2.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0-legacy can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0-legacy/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.0 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.0/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 3.1 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.1/vdldoc/>. 
- The VDL documentation for Liferay Faces 3.2 can be found at
  <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/>.

<!-- Re-add upon release. - Jim
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.1 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.1/vdldoc/>.
- The VDL documentation for the Liferay Faces 4.2 can be found at <http://docs.liferay.com/faces/4.2/vdldoc/>.
-->

Each link for the VDL documentation contains information about all the `aui`,
`aui-cc`, `bridge`, `liferay-ui`, `liferay-util`, and `liferay-security` tags
for that version of the Liferay Faces Bridge, so each VDL documentation link
basically holds the entirety of the PortletFaces tag library documentation (with
the exception of certain tags which are excluded from certain versions of the
Lfieray Faces Bridge). 

### Migrating GenericFacesPortlet [](id=migrate-genericfacesportlet-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

PortletFaces Bridge provided its own
`org.portletfaces.bridge.GenericFacesPortlet` class but the Liferay Faces Bridge
uses the JSR 329 standard `javax.portlet.faces.bridge.GenericFacesPortlet`
class. In order to ease migration, the old class still exists in Liferay Faces
Bridge although it has been deprecated. It is recommended that the standard
class name be used in all `WEB-INF/portlet.xml` `portlet-class` entries. 

    <!-- PortletFaces Bridge GenericFacesPortlet -->
    <portlet-app>
        <portlet>
            ...
            <portlet-class>
                org.portletfaces.bridge.GenericFacesPortlet
            </portlet-class>
            ...
        </portlet>
    </portlet-app>

    <!-- Liferay Faces Bridge GenericFacesPortlet -->
    <portlet-app>
        <portlet>
            ...
            <portlet-class>
                javax.portlet.faces.GenericFacesPortlet
            </portlet-class>
            ...
        </portlet>
    </portlet-app>

Next we'll look at the new version of the `LiferayFacesContext`.

### Migrating LiferayFacesContext [](id=migrate-liferayfacescontext-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

PortletFaces provided a class named
`org.portletfaces.liferay.faces.context.LiferayFacesContext` class but Liferay
Faces Portal uses the `com.liferay.faces.portal.context.LiferayFacesContext`
class. In order to ease migration, the old class still exists in Liferay Faces
Portal although it has been deprecated. It is recommended that the standard
class name be used instead. 

    // LiferayFaces package name:
    import org.portletfaces.liferay.faces.context.LiferayFacesContext;

    // Liferay Faces Portal package name:
    import com.liferay.faces.portal.context.LiferayFacesContext;
 
The next section explains some of the changes in Logging between PortletFaces
and Liferay Faces. 

### Migrating Logging [](id=migrate-to-liferay-faces-logging-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

The PortletFaces-Logging project at portletletfaces.org has been moved into the
Liferay Faces Bridge codebase. In order to keep using this logging API in your
portlets, you will need to refactor to the new package namespace, as deprecated
classes have not been provided. 

    // PortletFaces-Logging package names:
    import org.portletfaces.logging.LoggerFactory;
    import org.portletfaces.logging.Logger;

    // Liferay Faces Bridge package names:
    import com.liferay.faces.util.logging.LoggerFactory;
    import com.liferay.faces.util.logging.Logger;

The last migration we'll look at is Portlet Preferences.

### Migrating Portlet Preferences [](id=migrate-liferay-faces-portlet-preferences-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

PortletFaces Bridge provided its own
`org.portletfaces.bridge.preference.Preference` class but Liferay Faces Bridge
uses the JSR 329 standard `javax.portlet.faces.preference.Preference` class. In
order to migrate to the standard class, you will need to refactor to the new
package namespace as deprecated classes have not been provided. 

    // PortletFaces Bridge package name:
    import org.portletfaces.bridge.preference.Preference;

    // Liferay Faces Bridge package name:
    import javax.portlet.faces.preference.Preference;

And those are all the changes necessary to migrate projects from the
PortletFaces Bridge to the Liferay Faces Bridge. 

## Migrating From Liferay Faces 3.1 to Liferay Faces 3.2/4.2 [](id=migrating-from-liferay-faces-3-1-to-life-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Liferay Faces 3.2 and 4.2 are compatible with Liferay Portal 6.2 (see the [Liferay Faces Version Scheme](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
for more info on Liferay Portal compatibility). Migrating to Liferay Faces
3.2/4.2 from Liferay Faces 3.1 requires a few changes to ensure your projects
continue working correctly. 

In this section, we'll cover the following migration topics: 

- Migrating Liferay Faces Alloy Tags for Liferay Faces 3.2/4.2
- Migrating the `liferay-portlet.xml` File for Liferay Faces 3.2/4.2

First, let's explore Liferay Faces Alloy tag migration. 

### Migrating Liferay Faces Alloy 3.1 Tags to Liferay Faces Alloy 3.2/4.2 Tags [](id=migrating-liferay-faces-alloy-3-1-tags-t-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

AlloyUI was upgraded from AlloyUI 1.5 to AlloyUI 2.0 between Liferay Portal 6.1
and Liferay Portal 6.2. The AlloyUI changes include the deprecation and removal
of some JavaScript functionality, and the addition of some JavaScript
widgets. As a result, in Liferay Faces 3.2 and 4.2, corresponding Liferay Faces Alloy
tags are deprecated and some are replaced. We'll go over the Liferay Faces
Alloy tag changes that you'll need to accommodate in your Facelets. 

First, let's look at the changes to the `aui` namespace tags. 

#### Changes to the Liferay Faces Alloy `aui` Tags [](id=changes-to-the-liferay-faces-alloy-aui-t-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

The following table identifies the `aui` tags that are deprecated in 3.2/4.2 and
each tag's replacement, if a replacement exists.

**Tag Deprecations in the `aui` Namespace**

| Deprecated `aui` Tag | Replacement `aui` Tag |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| `aui:column` | [`aui:row`](http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/aui/row.html) and  [`aui:col`](http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/aui/col.html) |
| `aui:layout` | No Replacement |

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** The `aui:column` tag must be replaced
 by an `aui:col` tag that is nested within an `aui:row` tag. 

 Also, because `aui:col` has completely different attributes than `aui:column`,
 you must account for the `aui:col` attributes. For more information on the
 `aui:col` tag, see the
 [VDLdocs for Liferay Faces 3.2](http://docs.liferay.com/faces/3.2/vdldoc/).

---

Next, we'll look at the changes to the tags in the `aui-cc` namespace.

#### Changes to the Liferay Faces Alloy `aui-cc` Tags [](id=changes-to-the-liferay-faces-alloy-aui-c-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Below is a table of the `aui-cc` tags that are deprecated or removed with
respect to the Liferay Faces 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 releases: 

**Tag Deprecations in the `aui-cc` Namespace**

| Deprecated `aui-cc` Tag |
|-------------------------|
| `aui-cc:button` |
| `aui-cc:input` |
| `aui-cc:select` |
| `aui-cc:message` (**REMOVED in 4.1/4.2**) |
| `aui-cc:messages` (**REMOVED in 4.1/4.2**) |

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** The `aui-cc:message` and
 `aui-cc:messages` tags  have been completely removed in 4.1/4.2 because no
 analogous tags in Liferay Portal exist for them and their
 functionality is already implemented in the bridge's for `h:message` and
 `h:messages` tags, respectively. 

---

Now that we've learned the AlloyUI related migration changes, we'll look at the
modifications necessary to use Liferay Faces 3.1 portlets in Liferay Portal 6.2. 

### Migrating the liferay-portlet.xml File for Liferay Faces 3.2/4.2 [](id=migrating-the-liferay-portlet-xml-file-f-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)

Liferay Portal 6.2 has two compatible Liferay Faces Versions: 3.2 and 4.2. We provide
Liferay Faces 3.2 for compatibility with JSF 2.1 and provide Liferay Faces 4.2
for compatibility with JSF 2.2 (see the [Liferay Faces Version Scheme](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
for more info on Liferay Portal and JSF compatibility). If you are currently
using Liferay Faces 3.1 and are interested in upgrading from Liferay
Portal 6.1 to 6.2, but aren't interested in compatibility with JSF 2.2, you should
upgrade from Liferay Faces 3.1 to 3.2. But, if you want to use JSF 2.2 in addition to Liferay 6.2,
you must upgrade to Liferay Faces 4.2. 

---

 ![Note](../../images/tip.png) **Note:** This guide only addresses upgrading as
 it relates to Liferay Portal. Upgrading from JSF 2.1 to 2.2 may require
 additional changes. For information on upgrading to JSF 2.2 you should check
 out JSF specific upgrade guides. 

---

Liferay Portal 6.2 can enforce namespacing of portlet request parameters. But
you must turn this off for your JSF portlets by specifying
`<requires-namespaced-parameters>false</requires-namespaced-parameters>` in each
`<portlet>` element of your portlet project's `WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml`
file. Here's a snippet that specifies this descriptor: 

    <liferay-portlet-app>
        <portlet>

            ...

            <requires-namespaced-parameters>false</requires-namespaced-parameters>

            ...

        </portlet>

        ...

    </liferay-portlet-app>

Turning off the parameter namespace requirement is all you need to do to upgrade
your JSF portlets to Liferay Faces 3.2 or 4.2, for use in Liferay Portal 6.2. 

As an example JSF portlet that runs on Liferay Portal 6.2, check out the
[demo JSF2-portlet](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/3.2.x/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet)
and its 
[`liferay-portlet.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/3.2.x/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/liferay-portlet.xml)
file. 

Next, we'll show you how to build the Liferay Faces project. 

## Building Liferay Faces From Source [](id=building-liferay-faces-from-source-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

You may have several reasons for downloading and building Liferay Faces from its
project sourcee code: 
- To try out the latest cutting edge changes
- To investigate a suspected bug
- To learn how Liferay Faces is implemented

Whatever your reasons may be, we're happy to show you how to access the Liferay
Faces source code and build it. 

We'll start with installing the liferay-faces project. 

### Installing the liferay-faces Project [](id=installing-the-liferay-faces-project-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

It's important to install the version of Liferay Faces that you want. So, it's a
good idea to check the [Liferay Faces Version Scheme](http://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/liferay-faces-version-scheme-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-04-en)
to confirm the version of Liferay Faces. 

You can either install the project by cloning it from GitHub or by downloading
it as a `.zip` file. We'll demonstrate both options.

**Cloning the project from GitHub**

Cloning the project, requires that you [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) 
on your machine. Once you've set up Git, you can download the liferay-faces
project from GitHub and work with a particular branch of the project, following
these instructions: 

1.  Execute the following command from your terminal:

        git clone https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces.git

2.  Navigate into that directory by executing `cd liferay-faces`.

3.  Checkout the branch (`master` is the default branch) you want to use.

    For example, to use the first milestone release of version 4.2.0, execute
    the following command:

        git checkout 4.2.0-m1

**Downloading the project as a `.zip` file**

To download the liferay-faces project as a `.zip` file, follow these
instructions: 

1.  Visit the Liferay Faces project page,
    [https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces). 

2.  Click on the *branch* drop-down menu and select the branch or tag for the
    version of the liferay-faces project that you'd like to use. 

3.  Click on the *Download Zip* button to download the `[branch/tag name].zip`
    file for that branch or tag. 

4.  Extract the `.zip` file contents to a location on your machine.

5.  In a terminal window, navigate into the liferay-faces project's root
    directory: 

        cd liferay-faces-[version]

Now that you've installed the liferay-faces project, you can configure your
environment for building the project. 

### Building Liferay Faces with Maven [](id=building-liferay-faces-with-maven-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

Maven is required to build the liferay-faces project. You can download Maven
from
[http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
We recommend putting your Maven installation's `bin` directory in your system's
`$PATH`, so you can run the Maven executable (`mvn`) easily from your terminal. 

1.  Copy the `externalLiferayFacesRepositories` `<profile>` from
    [`settings.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/settings.xml)
    into your local `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` file. If you do not already have a
    `settings.xml` file in your Maven configuration, create a `settings.xml`
    file in your `$HOME/.m2` folder and copy the contents of the
    [`settings.xml`](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/master/settings.xml)
    file into it. 

2.  Build the source with Maven by executing the following command: 

        mvn clean package

Maven builds the following Liferay Faces artifacts: 

-   `alloy/target/liferay-faces-alloy-[version].jar`
-   `bridge-api/target/liferay-faces-bridge-api-[version].jar`
-   `bridge-impl/target/liferay-faces-bridge-impl-[version].jar`
-   `portal/target/liferay-faces-portal-[version].jar`
-   `util/target/liferay-faces-util-[version].jar`

That's it; you've built Liferay Faces from source! 

In the next section, we'll reflect on what we've learned about developing JSF
portlets with Liferay Faces. 

## Summary [](id=liferay-faces-documentation-summary-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-en)

You've come a long way since the initial sections on developing JSF portlets in
Liferay Faces. You jumped right in with creating and deploying a JSF portlet
using Liferay IDE. Then, you enhanced your portlet by implementing portlet
preferences, internationalizing your portlet content, enabling your portlets to
communicate with IPC, and context-scoping your managed beans with CDI. You
learned how the Liferay Faces Bridge provides you with means to develop and
deploy your JSF web apps as portlets. 

You discovered how easy it was to use some of Liferay Portal's most common
utilities and UI components via Liferay Faces Portal. And you surveyed the
powerful AlloyUI components available through Liferay Faces Alloy. And let's not
forget that Liferay Faces lets you use todays most popular JSF UI component
suites including PrimeFaces, ICEFaces, and RichFaces. Liferay Faces provides you
with the best options for creating JSF portlets on any JSR 286 (Portlet
2.0) compliant portlet container; and using Liferay IDE/Developer Studio, you can
develop your JSF apps quickly and easily.
