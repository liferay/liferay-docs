Liferay Portal is a very flexible platform that allows creating a wide variety
of portals and websites. It is the developer through custom applications and
customizations who gives it the shape desired by the end users of the portal.
Liferay provides several tools (Plugins SDK and Liferay IDE) to ease this task.
It also provides the foundations and frameworks to either implement completely
new applications (portlet plugins) or customize the core functionalities and
applications provided with Liferay (hook plugins and ext plugins).

As the official Developer's Guide for Liferay, this document has offered a
description of each of the tools and frameworks that you as a developer can use
to build the bests portals out there. Of course, while this document is large,
it is just the beginning, the more you learn, the more efficient you will be
while developing and the more interesting applications and customizations you
will create. Here are some suggestions to learn more after reading this guide:

- Read the "[Liferay in
  Action](http://affiliate.manning.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=1133&url=7&tid1=liferaywebsite)"
  book. This book, written by Rich Sezov, Liferay's Knowledge Manager, provides
  a very extensive step by step guide of Liferay's development technologies.
- Use [Liferay's Community Forums](http://forum.liferay.com/), not only to ask
  questions but also to to answer them. You will be surprised how much you can
  learn while trying to help others.
- Read the source. Liferay is Open Source, and you can leverage that to learn as
  much as you want about it. Download the code if you haven't done it yet and read
  it. Link it within your IDE so that you can enter Liferay's code while debugging
  your own code. It will give you a great opportunity to learn as much as the
  greatest expert of Liferay in the world.
- Go to the websites of the standards and libraries that Liferay is based on and
  read their documentation. Some examples are:
  [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/),
  [Portlet Specification](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=286), etc.
