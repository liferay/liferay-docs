# Leveraging the Mobile SDK

The Liferay Mobile SDK is a framework for building native mobile apps that
integrate with your different Liferay Portal instances and their portlets. The
SDK provides the means for your mobile apps to easily consume Liferay Portal's
core web services and the web services of your custom portlets. It wraps Liferay
JSON web services, takes care of authentication, makes REST (Representational
State Transfer) requests (synchronously or asynchronously), parses JSON results,
and handles server side exceptions. The Liferay Mobile SDK is compatible with
Liferay Portal 6.2 and later, and it comes with the Liferay Android SDK and
Liferay iOS SDK ready for you to download and use.

We'll discuss the following topics as we explore Liferay's Mobile SDK:

- Using the Android SDK
- Using the iOS SDK
- Building an SDK for Custom Portlet Services

Let's get started by learning how to access Liferay's core services from an
Android app.
