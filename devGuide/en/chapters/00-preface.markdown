# Preface [](id=pref-11)
This guide was written as a quick reference to help you get started developing
on the Liferay Portal platform. It is a guide for those who want to get their
hands dirty using Liferay's framework and APIs to create fantastic websites.

For a more exhaustive view into Liferay development, we encourage you to check
