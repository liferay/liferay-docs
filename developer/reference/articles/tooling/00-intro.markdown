# Tooling

You can write code for @product@ using any standard toolset. Liferay is
tool-agnostic, which frees you to work with whatever you're already productive
using.

Liferay has also created its own tools that streamline @product@ development.
These tools integrate with popular build environments (e.g., Gradle and Maven).
They include

- [Blade CLI](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/blade-cli): a command
  line interface used to build and manage Liferay Workspaces and @product@
  projects. This CLI is intended for Gradle or Maven development.
- [Liferay Workspace](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/liferay-workspace):
  a generated Gradle/Maven environment built to hold and manage @product@
  projects.
- [Liferay Dev Studio](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/liferay-dev-studio):
  an Eclipse-based IDE supporting development for @product@.
- [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/intellij-idea):
  a plugin providing support for @product@ development with IntelliJ IDEA.

Liferay also provides a plethora of
[Gradle](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/gradle) and
[Maven plugins](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/maven) you can apply
to your projects. Many of these are already built into tools such as Liferay
Workspace.

Want samples or predefined project templates? Liferay has you covered with 30+
[project templates](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/project-templates)
and many more
[project samples](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/sample-projects).

If you're a newbie looking for the best development tool for @product@, or even
a seasoned veteran looking for a tool you may like more than your current setup,
this section answers your tooling questions.
