# Tooling

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can write code for @product@ using any standard toolset. Liferay is
tool-agnostic, which frees you to work with whatever you're already productive
using.

Liferay has also created its own tools that streamline @product@ development.
These tools integrate with popular build environments (e.g., Gradle, Maven, and 
NodeJS). They include

- [Blade CLI](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/blade-cli): a command
  line interface used to build and manage Liferay Workspaces and @product@
  projects. This CLI is intended for Gradle or Maven development.
- [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-workspace):
  a generated Gradle/Maven environment built to hold and manage @product@
  projects.
- [Liferay Dev Studio](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/liferay-dev-studio):
  an Eclipse-based IDE supporting development for @product@.
- [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/intellij):
  a plugin providing support for @product@ development with IntelliJ IDEA.
- [Liferay Theme Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-generator):
  a generator that creates themes, layouts templates, and themelets for 
  @product@ development.
- [Liferay Bundle Generator](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/bundle-generator):
  a generator that creates JavaScript portlets with JavaScript tooling.

Liferay also provides a plethora of
[Gradle](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/gradle-plugins) and
[Maven plugins](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven-plugins) you can
apply to your projects. Many of these are already built into tools such as
Liferay Workspace.

Want samples or predefined project templates? Liferay has you covered with 30+
[project templates](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/project-templates)
and many more
[project samples](/docs/7-2/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/sample-projects).

If you're a newbie looking for the best development tool for @product@, or even
a seasoned veteran looking for a tool you may like more than your current setup,
this section answers your tooling questions.
