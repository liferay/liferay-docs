# Installing Blade CLI

You can install Blade CLI using the Liferay Project SDK installer. This installs
JPM and Blade CLI into your user home folder and optionally initializes a
[Liferay Workspace](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/liferay-workspace)
folder. Do not use the Liferay Project SDK installer to update Blade CLI;
instead, follow the instructions for
[updating Blade CLI](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/updating-blade-cli).

If you must configure proxy settings for Blade CLI, follow the
[Installing Blade CLI with Proxy Requirements](/developer/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-2/installing-blade-cli-with-proxy-requirements) instructions instead.

Follow the steps below to download and install Blade CLI:

1.  Download the latest
    [Liferay Project SDK installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20IDE/)
    that corresponds with your operating system (e.g., Windows, MacOS, or
    Linux). The Project SDK installer is listed under *Liferay IDE*, so the
    folder versions are based on IDE releases. You can select an installer
    without @ide@ if you don't intend to use it. The Project SDK installer is
    available for versions 3.2.0+. Do **not** select the large
    green download button; this downloads Liferay Portal instead.

2.  Run the installer. 

3.  Select the Java Runtime to use with Blade CLI. Then click *OK*.

4.  Click *Next* to step through the installer's introduction.

5.  If you'd like to initialize a Liferay Workspace, you can set its location. 

    ![Figure 1: Determine where your Liferay Workspace should reside, if you want one.](../../../images/blade-installer-workspace-init.png)

    Select *Don't initialize Liferay Workspace directory* if you only want to
    install Blade CLI. Then click *Next*.

6.  If you initialized a Liferay Workspace folder, an additional option appears
    for selecting the Liferay product type to use with your workspace. Choose
    the product type and click *Next*.

7.  Click *Next* to begin installing Blade CLI/Liferay Workspace on your
    computer.

That's it! Blade CLI is installed on your machine! If you specified a location
to initialize a Liferay Workspace folder, that is also available.
