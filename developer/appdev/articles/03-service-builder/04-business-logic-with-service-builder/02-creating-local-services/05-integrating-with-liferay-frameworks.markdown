# Integrating with Liferay's Frameworks

[TOC levels=1-4]

New car buyers expect certain standard features: power windows, cruise control,
floor mats (at least the cheap ones), and so on. Similarly, users expect
applications to have certain features, and those features should behave
consistently across applications. 

For example, a user might expect the app's content can be shared on social
networks, tagged and rated, and discussed in comments. Liferay's frameworks
implement these features users expect to see. Integrating with the frameworks is
easy, and the frameworks provide intuitive, consistent user experiences. 

Here are some of Liferay's most popular frameworks:

[Permissions](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/defining-application-permissions):
Defines resources and permissions for entities and actions that can be performed
on them.

[Configurable Applications](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/configurable-applications):
Provide configuration screens in the Control Panel. 

[Workflow](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/workflow):
Equips entities for reviewing in workflows before publishing. 

[Item Selector](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/item-selector): 
Provides a consistent experience for browsing and selecting entities. 

[Asset Framework](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/asset-framework): 
Provides a way to make entity data generic, so common tasks can be performed on
them. This enables users to tag, categorize, rate, prioritize, and comment on
anything that has been asset-enabled. Users can relate entities to each other as
assets, and entities can be published in the Asset Publisher. 

-   [Tags and Categories](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/implementing-asset-categorization-and-tagging):
    Enables users to tag entities and categorize them into logical hierarchies. 
-   [Priority](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/implementing-asset-priority):
    Users can ascribe numerical priorities to entities. 
-   [Related Assets](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/relating-assets):
    Users can associate one entity with another as an asset. 
-   [Asset Renderer](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/rendering-an-asset):
    Enables entities appearing in Asset Publisher queries. 
-   [Comments](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/adding-comments-to-your-app):
    Lets users comment on entities.
-   [Ratings](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/rating-assets):
    Enables rating systems, such as five stars or thumbs up/down, on entities. 
-   [Flags](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/flagging-inappropriate-asset-content):
    Users can flag entity content as inappropriate. 
-   [Social Bookmarks](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/applying-social-bookmarks):
    Users can share entity content on Twitter, Facebook, and more. 

[Export/Import](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/export-import-and-staging):
Export entity data to and import entity data from files (`.lpkg` files).
Exported data can be imported to another portal instance or saved for later use. 

[Staging](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/export-import-and-staging): 
Modify content behind the scenes without affecting the live site, and then
publish to the live site when the content is ready. 

[Search](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/search): 
Index entities for searching. 

[Recycle Bin](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/moving-entities-to-the-recycle-bin): 
Instead of deleting entities, put them into the Recycle Bin. Entities can be
restored from the Recycle Bin or deleted permanently (manually or per
a schedule).
