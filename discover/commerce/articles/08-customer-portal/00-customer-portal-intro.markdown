# Customer Portal [](id=customer-portal)

The Beryl Customer Portal is a sample store that models a B2B scenario in which
each buyer is provided with an account through which to conduct transactions.
Beryl can be used simply as a sandbox to gain familiarity with @commerce@, but
it can also give you a head start on setting up a fully functional store.

Beryl gives you a working portal with an account management system, a sample
catalog, and working pages for checkout, order processing and managing
shipments. Other features, such as payment methods, shipping methods, and taxes,
still need to be set up manually.
