# Flat Rate Shipping [](id=fixed-shipping-method)

When you create a flat rate shipping option, you create an option that any buyer
can choose to use to ship any product. By creating multiple flat rate options,
you can give customers various choices in terms of cost, speed, and security.

Flat rate shipping imposes the same cost on every product in the catalog.
However, you can create exceptions for individual products from the *Shipping
Extra Price* field in the product's
[Configuration](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowlede_base/1-0/configuration#shipping)
tab.
