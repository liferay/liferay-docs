# Product Relations [](id=product-relations)

Product relations can be used to connect products irrespective of category,
typically for the purpose of displaying links to one product on the detail page
of another. Multiple types of product relations are supported, with the
following types available out of the box:

**Up-sell:** Display products that are comparable to the featured product
but have a higher sale value.

**Spare:** Display products that are spare parts or components for the featured
product.

**Related:** A catch-all set.

**Accessories:** Display add-on products for use in conjunction with the featured products.

**Cross-sell:** Display products complementary to the featured product.

As far as the software is concerned, all these types are identical---the
difference is in how you choose to use them. By populating each type with
different product relations, you gain the ability to display multiple sets of
relations on a single page.

## Adding Product Relationship Types [](id=setting-product-relationship-types)

The different types of product relations are flexible. Since each one functions
the same way, you can add, remove, or rename types at will. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Commerce*
    &rarr; *Product Relationship Types*.

2.  Click *Add* to create a new type, or click the
    ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png) button to edit or delete an
    existing one.

3.  Remember, the different relation types differ only in name, so the name is
    the only setting you have to worry about. Whether you're editing or creating
    new, just set the name and then click *Save*.

    Click *Add*.

## Displaying Product Relations [](id=displaying-product-relations)

You can display product relations on a product display page by configuring
a search results portlet. You must have a 
[product display page](discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/product-detail-page) 
in place first.

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to your product display page and place a *Search Results* widget on the
    page.

2.  Go to the widget's ![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png) menu and
    click *Configuration*.

3.  Go to the *Configuration Method* drop-down menu and choose a product
    relationship type to be displayed in the widget.

4.  Click *Save*.
