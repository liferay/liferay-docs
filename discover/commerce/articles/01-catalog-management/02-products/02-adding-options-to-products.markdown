# Adding Options to Products [](id=assigning-options-to-products)

**An option** is a product feature that a buyer can select or specify. To create
an option and apply it to a product, you must first create an 
[option template](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/options). 
Then you can apply that template to any product in your catalog.

Once you apply a template to a product, you can make any changes to the
product's option that you want. These changes will not affect the option
template or any other product.

## Applying an Option Template to a Product [](id=assigning-an-option-template-to-a-product)

To assign an option template to a product, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the catalog, open a product, and click on the *Options* tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button and select option
    templates from the pop-up. Click *Add* to close the pop-up.

## Editing an Option Template [](id=editing-an-option-template-at-the-product-scope)

Once an option template has been applied to a product, you can make changes to
the option that only affect that product. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to the catalog, select the product in question, and open the *Options*
    tab. If you just finished applying a template to the product, then you are
    already on this page.

2.  On the left side of the page is a list of the option templates this product
    uses. Click on the one you want to edit.

3.  Make changes to the *Option Detail* form on the right side of the page and
    then hit *Save*. The form contains most of the information that was entered
    when the template was created, but includes a *Priority* field. Priority
    indicates where on a page the option is displayed---lower numbers come
    first.

## Editing Option Values [](id=creating-option-values-at-the-product-scope)

After an option template has been applied to a product, you can edit and delete
its option values or add new ones. These changes will not affect the template or
any other product. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to the catalog and select the desired product. Click on the *Options*
    tab, find the template for which you want to create values and click on the
    *values* button next to its title. This displays a list of option values.

2.  To edit a value, select it and then make changes to the *Option
    Value Detail* form on the right. To delete it, select it and then hit
    *delete*.

    Alternatively, to add a new value, click on the
    ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the *Option Value
    Detail* form.

3.  Click *Save*. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create or edit additional values.
