# Images [](id=images)

A product image or video is a media file that has a relationship to a particular
product. This relationship can be used to ensure that the appropriate images are
displayed on product detail pages, in search results, or anywhere else
information about the product is displayed. Images can also be associated with
a specific product variant.

Follow these steps to create a product image:

1. Go to the product's page (*Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select product),
   click on the *Images* tab and then the *Add* button in the upper-right to
   display the *Add Image* form. Click *Select File* to upload a new image or
   video, or to select one from the documents and media repository. Set
   a priority to control the order in which attachments will be published on
   a page (lower numbers come first).

2. If you want to associate the image with a specific product variant, select
   one from the *Options* section of the *Add Image* form. (Variants will only
   be available to choose from if a product has options which are designated as
   SKU contributors. See 
   [Options](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/options)
   for details).

3. If you want the image to be displayed on the product page for a limited
   period of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule*
   section at the bottom of the form.
