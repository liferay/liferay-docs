# Attachments [](id=attachments)

An attachment is any kind of file that you want customers to be able to download
before they purchase. For instance, you can post a .pdf of a user manual, or
a video of a product demonstration.

Follow these steps to add an attachment to a product:

1.  Go to the product's page (*Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select
    product), click on the *Attachments* tab and then the *Add* button in the
    upper-right to display the *Add Attachment* form. Click *Select File* to
    upload a file or to select one from the documents and media repository. Set
    a priority to control the order in which attachments are published on a page
    (lower numbers come first).

2.  If you want to associate the attachment with a specific product variant,
    select one from the *Options* section of the *Add Attachment* form.
    (Variants are available to choose from only if a product has options
    designated as SKU contributors. See
    [Options](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/options)
    for details).

3.  If you want the attachment to be displayed on the product page for a limited
    period of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule*
    section at the bottom of the form.
