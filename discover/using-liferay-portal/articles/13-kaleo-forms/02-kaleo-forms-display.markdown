# Kaleo Forms Display [](id=kaleo-forms-display)

The Kaleo Forms Display portlet makes use of the workflow processes that you
create in the Kaleo Forms Admin portlet. Add the Kaleo Forms Display portlet to
a page if you haven't done so yet. Any forms available for processing through
the workflow can be initiated through the *Submit New* button, as the below
image indicates. 

![Figure 13.14: The Kaleo Forms Display portlet.](../../images/kaleo-forms-display.png)

To initiate a process in the workflow, click *Submit New* &rarr; *Lunar Resort 
News Content*. The portlet now displays the form you assigned to the first task 
in your workflow. Fill out the form and click *Save*. 

<!-- Above, you told the user to give the process a name, but you didn't specify
the name. Here, you refer to the name as *New Process*. This should have a
better, more imaginative name. Consider integrating this with the Lunar Resort
site mentioned in other chapters. In fact, this might be the way you can expand
coverage of the forms application. -Rich -->

The workflow now automatically guides the form on to the next step. For example, 
if you submit a new process using the Single Approver process created in the 
section above, it is assigned automatically to the Portal Content Reviewer role. 
If you are a Portal Content Reviewer, the task then appears in the 
*Assigned to My Roles* section of the Kaleo Forms Display portlet, and you 
receive a notification in your Dockbar. You can then assign it to yourself using 
the portlet and complete the task.
