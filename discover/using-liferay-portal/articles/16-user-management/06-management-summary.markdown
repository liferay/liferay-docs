# Summary [](id=summary-13)

In this chapter, we learned how to manage users, organizations, user groups, and
roles via Liferay's Control Panel. Site memberships and teams aren't the only
way for portal administrators to group and manage users: organizations can be
used to arrange users into hierarchical structures and user groups are a
flexible way to collect groups of users that transcend organizational
hierarchies. You can create roles to define permissions and scope them for the
entire portal or for a particular site or organization. User groups can be
assigned to roles; in this case, each member of the user group is assigned to
the role. We also looked at how to configure password policies for users and how
to view audit trails of what your users are doing in the portal. We'll
continue our coverage of Liferay's Control Panel next, where we'll examine
configurable portal and server settings.
