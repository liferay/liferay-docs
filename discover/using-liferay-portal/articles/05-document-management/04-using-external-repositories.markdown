# Using External Repositories [](id=using-external-repositories)

Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) is a specification for
improving interoperability between Enterprise Content Management systems.
Documents and Media allows users to connect to multiple third-party repositories
that support CMIS 1.0 with AtomPub and Web Services protocols.

Some of the features supported with third-party repositories include:

- Reading/writing documents and folders
- Document check-in, check-out, and undo check-out
- Downloading documents
- Moving folders and documents within the repository
- Getting revision history
- Reverting to revision

There are some subtle differences in setting up the different kinds of
third-party repositories for use in Documents and Media. But there are plenty of
similarities too.

Common Liferay configuration steps:

- Adjust the portal properties.
- Add any user accounts required by the repository.
- Add the repository.

Lastly, keep in mind your third-party repository may require installation and
deployment of an appropriate Liferay plugin. Plugins for SharePoint and
Documentum are available through Liferay's Marketplace.

Let's go through those steps, starting with setting our portal properties.

## Adjusting portal properties [](id=adjusting-portal-properties)

The admin must ensure that the same credentials and authentication are being
used in Liferay and in the external repository. This is normally synchronized
using a mechanism like LDAP. If you don't have LDAP, you need to ensure manually
that the credentials and authentication are the same. In order to authenticate
with the third-party repository, you need to store passwords for the user
sessions. Set the following portal property in your `portal-ext.properties`:

    session.store.password=true

Next, we need to make sure the login and password for Liferay are the same as 
the external repository. This is easily accomplished by using identical screen 
names, so in `portal-ext.properties` add the following: 

    company.security.auth.type=screenName

Alternatively, configure these properties in the Control Panel under *Portal 
Settings* &rarr; *Authentication*.

## Adding required repository users [](id=adding-required-repository-users)

Once these properties are set, you must create a user in Liferay with a
screen name and password matching the administrative user of your external
repository. Be sure to assign appropriate roles (e.g. Administrator) to that
user. Sign out of Liferay and sign in again as that new user. See sections of
the *Management* chapter on adding and managing users.

## Adding the repository [](id=adding-the-repository)

You can add new repositories from the UI by clicking the *Add* button from the
Home folder. Repositories can only be mounted in the Home folder.

![Figure 5.5: You can add a new repository by navigating to *Add* &rarr; *Repository* in the Documents and Media portlet.](../../images/05-new-repository.png)

All fields in this form are required, except for *Repository ID*. Leave this
field blank, and a repository ID is automatically generated by the system. When
finished, the repository is displayed on the left side of the window in the Home
folder.

Using this information, we can now add an example repository. As noted
previously, there are several repositories that work well with Liferay using
CMIS. One that is familiar to many users is SharePoint. In the exercise below,
we'll set up SharePoint as a Documents and Media repository.

## Example Repository Setup: SharePoint [](id=example-repository-setup-sharepoint)

<!-- Sharepoint currently does not work on Liferay. We're monitoring the
Sharepoint status and will update when it's working. Thus, Sharepoint repository
sections are not updated for 6.2. -->

With Liferay Portal you can connect to an external SharePoint server and add it
as a Documents and Media repository. This lets users collaborate and
share documents more easily between both environments. We will mount a
SharePoint repository via CMIS AtomPub and SharePoint SOAP web services.

Liferay uses a combination of SOAP and Representational State Transfer (REST),
based on the Atom convention, to connect to the SharePoint repository.
SharePoint provides various SOAP services for modifying and querying data from
its document library. Liferay uses Axis2 to generate SOAP calls to the
SharePoint server.

To use SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media repository, we'll do the
following:

- Configure the CMIS Connector on SharePoint.
- Activate a SharePoint site as a CMIS Producer.
- Acquire your SharePoint document library's repository ID.
- Enable Basic Authentication on the SharePoint host.
- Add SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media repository.

Note that this section is geared towards portal system administrators and
SharePoint system administrators.

Before you can use SharePoint as an external repository with Liferay portal, you
must verify that SharePoint is properly configured. Several services must be
set up on the SharePoint server before synchronizing with Liferay.

### Configuring the CMIS Connector on SharePoint [](id=configuring-the-cmis-connector-on-sharepoint)

SharePoint utilizes a CMIS Connector and a CMIS Producer to interface with
Liferay Portal. The Connector is installed with the SharePoint Administrator
Toolkit using a solution package called a Windows SharePoint file (.wsp). If you
don't have it already, install the SharePoint Administrator Toolkit for its CMIS
Connector. Install and deploy the CMIS Connector as a Farm Solution on
SharePoint.

The folder `Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Connectors`
contains the `spscmis.wsp` file. Choose the appropriate deployment settings and
deploy that file. When deployment completes, Solution Properties shows the
solution is successfully deployed to all target sites. Now it's time to
configure the CMIS Producer.

### Activating a SharePoint site as a CMIS Producer [](id=activating-a-sharepoint-site-as-a-cmis-producer)

The Producer makes SharePoint repositories available through the CMIS Connector.
Choose the SharePoint site containing the document libraries to be used as
document repositories. Every document library in this site is made available as
a repository through the CMIS connector.

Go to *Site Actions* &rarr; *Site Settings* &rarr; *Manage Site Features*.
Enable the *Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) Producer* by
clicking *Activate*.

Now any document library created under this site is CMIS enabled. Before we
leave our SharePoint console, let's take note of our SharePoint document
library's repository ID.

### Acquiring the SharePoint document library's repository ID [](id=acquiring-the-sharepoint-document-librarys-repository-id)

Acquiring your SharePoint document library's repository ID, or list ID, is
important as it must be specified in the AtomPub URL Liferay uses to connect
with the external repository. Finding it, however, can be a little confusing.
The easiest way to find the repository ID is by accessing the SharePoint
repository using a browser such as Mozilla Firefox.

Follow these steps to get the repository ID:

1. In SharePoint, open the desired library. 

2. Under Library Tools select *Library*.

3. Click on *Library Settings*, located to the far right.

4. The browser window refreshes displaying the repository ID between curly
braces '{' and '}' in the browser's address bar.

    ![Figure 5.6: The repository ID can be found by displaying the repository's URL in a Firefox browser.](../../images/05-sharepoint-list-id.png)

    The repository ID is highlighted in the figure above. For this 
    example, the repository ID is `6DFDA9-B547-4D1D-BF85-976863CDF533`.
    Therefore, the AtomPub URL you'd use when adding this repository in
    Documents and Media would resemble this: 

        http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/_vti_bin/cmis/rest/6DFDA9-B547-4D1D-BF85-976863CDF533?getRepositoryInfo.

Be sure to copy down this URL so you can use it to configure SharePoint as a
repository in Documents and Media. Next, let's enable Basic Authentication on
the SharePoint host.

### Enabling Basic Authentication on the SharePoint host [](id=enabling-basic-authentication-on-the-sharepoint-host)

For the CMIS connector and producer to work, Basic Authentication on IIS must be
enabled. This lets Liferay's SharePoint hook authenticate against the SharePoint
web services. Enable Basic Authentication on your SharePoint host.

You are now prepared to mount SharePoint as an external repository.

### Adding SharePoint as a Liferay Documents and Media repository [](id=adding-sharepoint-as-a-liferay-documents-and-media-repository)

With the SharePoint server configured, we now turn our attention to Liferay. As
mentioned in the common steps for adding an external repository, be sure to
adjust the portal properties and add any user accounts required by the
repository.

Here are the steps specific to configuring Liferay to use SharePoint:

1. Download and install the SharePoint hook from Marketplace. See the
*Downloading and Installing Apps* section of the *Leveraging the Liferay
Marketplace* chapter of this document for more information.

2. Add the Documents and Media portlet to a page, if you haven't done so
already.

3. In the Documents and Media portlet click *Add Repository* and enter the
following information:

    **Name:** Enter an arbitrary name for the repository.

    **Description:** Describe the repository.

    **Repository Type:** Select *SharePoint (AtomPub)*.

    **AtomPub URL:** Enter the applicable URL using the format below,
    substituting the SharePoint server's host name for *[host]* and the
    SharePoint document library's repository ID for *[repository ID]*:

        http://[host]/CMIS/_vti_bin/cmis/rest/[repository ID]?getRepositoryInfo

    **Repository ID:** Leave this field empty. Liferay searches for the first
    repository using the given parameters and sets this value to that
    repository's ID.

    **Site Path:** Enter data using the format below, the SharePoint server's
    host information for *[host]* and the SharePoint document library's
    repository name for *[repository path]*:

		http://[host]/[repository path]

4. Click *Save*.

The left navigation panel of your Documents and Media portlet now lists your
new repository.

+$$$

**Tip:** In the site path example below, notice how the
repository path has a folder `Shared Documents` consisting of two words.

		http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/Shared Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

The space between the words in the repository name must be accounted for when
setting the site path in Liferay. Replace the empty space with the string *%20*
so the site path value now looks like this:

		http://liferay-20jf4ic/CMIS/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

This should be done for any multi-word repository name.

Remember that connecting to an external SharePoint server and adding it as a
Documents and Media repository is a great way to give users flexibility for
sharing and collaborating on Microsoft Office documents.

Now let's look at configuring the Documents and Media portlet.
