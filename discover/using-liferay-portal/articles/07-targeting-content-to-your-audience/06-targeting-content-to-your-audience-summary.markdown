# Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to use Liferay' audience targeting app. This app
allows you to define custom user segments, target specific content to different
user segments, and create campaigns for different user segments. Liferay's
audience targeting app allows you generate reports so that you can measure the
effectiveness of your campaigns. Liferay's audience targeting app includes a
simulator so that you can preview how your site would appear to users belonging
to different user segments. You can create user segments by applying various
rules that reference session attributes, profile attributes, behavior, and
possibly other information, such as information from social networks. It's also
easy for developers to create additional rules and rule types.
