# Server Administration [](id=server-administration)

The Server Administration application (accessed by clicking *Control Panel
&rarr; Configuration &rarr; Server Administration*) lets you perform tasks
related to the @product@ server. Clicking the link displays a graph showing the 
resources available in the JVM.

![Figure 1: Server Administration is where you configure and monitor many aspects of the server.](../../../images/server-admin-resources.png)

**Note:** Liferay DXP customers can use Liferay Connected Services (LCS) to
obtain additional performance metrics. If you're a DXP customer, see the
[LCS documentation](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)
for more information.

The Server Administration functionality is broken into several tabs:

- [Resources](#resources)
- [Log Levels](#log-levels)
- [Properties](#properties)
- [CAPTCHA](#captcha)
- [Data Migration](#data-migration)
- [File Uploads](#file-uploads)
- [Mail](#mail)
- [External Services](#external-services)
- [Script](#script)
- [Shutdown](#shutdown)

## Resources [](id=resources)

The Resources tab contains several server wide actions that an administrator can
execute. These include the following items:

**Run the garbage collector** 
: Tells the JVM to free memory by running the garbage collector. 

**Generate a thread dump**
: Generates a thread dump for later scrutiny to determine the presence 
and locations of any deadlocks. Useful during performance testing, but 
you must add a logger category for
`com.liferay.server.admin.web.internal.portlet.action.EditServerMVCActionCommand`
and set it to `INFO` before executing.

**Clear content cached by this VM**
: Clears content stored in the local cache. Only local JVM scope Ehcache content 
is cleared, not clustered Ehcache.

**Clear content cached across the cluster**
: Clears the content of the entire clustered Ehcache.

**Clear the database cache**
: Clears the database cache. Does not clear any Ehcache content except database 
results at the persistence layer.

**Clear the direct servlet cache** 
: Clears the direct servlet cache. In case emergency fixes must be applied, this
action allows an administrator to manually clear out the cache to force JSPs to
reload.

The direct servlet context optimizes JSP serving performance by caching and 
accessing the generated servlets directly instead of accessing them over the 
application server's dispatcher chain. This function is only suitable for cases 
where no filter is required for the JSPs; it should be enabled for production 
mode to improve performance, but disabled for development mode to allow JSP 
servlets to be reloaded on the fly. See the Direct Servlet Context section of 
the `portal.properties` file for details.

**Reindex all search indexes**
: Regenerates all search indexes. If you are not using a Solr search server this
impacts portal performance so try to do this at non-peak times.

**Reindex all spell check indexes**
: Regenerates all spell check indexes.

**Reindex com.liferay...SomeEntity**
: Reindexes a single entity.

**Verify database tables of all plugins**
: Checks all tables against their indexes for data retrieval accuracy.

**Verify Membership Policies** 
: Checks that existing site membership policies were correctly applied and
automatically makes updates. If the Liferay database is changed manually or is
hacked--resulting in a user assigned to a site in violation of a site
membership policy--this action triggers the verification methods of all
implemented site membership policies. Changes are automatically made to any
memberships in violation.

**Reset preview and thumbnail files for the Documents and Media portlet**
: Regenerates previews of each item in your Documents and Media libraries.

**Clean up permissions** 
: Removes permissions on the Guest, User, and Power User roles to simplify the
management of "User Customizable Pages". The "Add To Page" permissions is
removed from the Guest and User roles for all portlets, and is reduced in scope
for Power Users from portal-wide to "User Personal Site."

**Clean up portlet preferences** 
: This action cleans up database entries if portlet preferences become orphaned
in the @product@ database.

## Log Levels [](id=log-levels)

Here, you can make dynamic modifications of log levels for any class hierarchy
in @product@. Custom objects not on the list can be added with the *Add
Category* tab. Changes to the log level near the top of the class hierarchy
(such as at `com.liferay`) also changes log levels for all the classes under
that hierarchy. Modifications unnecessarily high in the hierarchy generate too
many messages to be useful.

## Properties [](id=properties)

Liferay and the JVM contain many settings which are defined as properties. The
properties tab has two sub-tabs: System Properties and Portal Properties.

The system properties tab shows an exhaustive list of system properties for the
JVM, as well as many @product@ system properties. This information can be used
for debugging purposes or to check the currently running configuration.

The portal properties tab shows an exhaustive list of the current portal
property values, so you don't have to shut down @product@ or open the properties
file directly. Portal properties are customizable; you can peruse the full list
of available
[portal properties](@platform-ref@/7.0-latest/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html).

## CAPTCHA [](id=captcha)

CAPTCHA is designed to thwart bots from registering for accounts. By default,
@product@ ships with its own CAPTCHA service. 

Alternatively, Google's reCAPTCHA service can be enabled from the CAPTCHA tab of
Server Administration. Check the *Enable ReCAPTCHA* box, enter your public and
private keys into the provided fields, and click *Save*. @product@ then uses
reCAPTCHA instead of the native CAPTCHA solution.

## Data Migration [](id=data-migration)

This tab is for upgrading @product@ or migrating its data from one system to
another without writing custom scripts.

The first section, under *Migrate data from one database to another.* was useful
in past versions of @product@ for copying the entire @product@ database to a new
database. However, the database migration tool cannot be used in the current
version of @product@ and will be removed in the next version of @product@.

The second section, *Migrate documents from one repository to another*, helps
you migrate your documents to a new repository on a different disk or in a new 
format. Before running this operation,
[configure the repository hook](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/document-repository-configuration)
in a `portal-ext.properties` file. Then, in Server Administration, select the
Document Library hook that represents the desired destination and click
*Execute*. After the process completes, shut down @product@, make the new
repository the default in the `portal-ext.properties` file, and restart.

## File Uploads [](id=file-uploads)

Since @product@ allows users to upload files in various places, you may want to
restrict the type and size of files users are allowed to upload. The File
Uploads tab lets you set the overall maximum file size and then grant exceptions
to that limit for specific applications. You can also limit the allowed file
extensions generally or by application.

## Mail [](id=mail)

Instead of using a `portal-ext.properties` file to configure a mail server, you
can configure a mail server from the Mail tab. If your 
[message boards receive mail](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-forums-with-message-boards#user-subscriptions-and-mailing-lists),
you can connect a POP mail server. If @product@ sends mail (useful for sending
notifications to users), you can connect to an SMTP server. We highly recommend
setting up mail servers.

Note that if you configure mail server settings here in the Control Panel, these
settings override any mail server settings in your `portal-ext.properties`
file.

## External Services [](id=external-services)

@product@ lets users upload and share content via the Documents and Media
library, a customizable and permissions-enabled online repository for files.
Users can upload files of any type to the Documents and Media library. @product@
ships with PDFBox for generating automatic previews for certain types of
documents. You can install three additional tools that offer higher quality
previews and document conversion functionality: OpenOffice or LibreOffice,
ImageMagick and Xuggler. With @product@ configured to use these tools, you can
generate automatic previews for many types of files including text files, office
suite files, PDFs, images, audio files and videos. Users can also use the
conversion functionality to download documents in a variety of formats. Please
see the 
[article on publishing files in @product@](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/publishing-files).

LibreOffice is available here: 
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org),
ImageMagick is available here: 
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org), and Xuggler is available here: 
[Xuggler](http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/). Make sure to
choose the correct versions of these applications for your operating system. We
recommend that you install the latest stable versions. LibreOffice and
ImageMagick must be installed manually, but you can install Xuggler from
the Control Panel.

+$$$

**Tip:** If you're running @product@ on a Linux server and experience a problem
enabling Xuggler, check your server's glibc version. You might have to update
glibc to version 2.6 or later in order for Xuggler to work.

$$$

Once you've installed these tools, you can use the Control Panel's External
Services tab to configure @product@ to use them.

### OpenOffice/LibreOffice configuration [](id=openoffice-libreoffice-configuration)

OpenOffice and LibreOffice are open source office suites which are usually run
in graphical mode to create documents, but they can also be run in server
mode. When run in server mode, OpenOffice and LibreOffice can be used to convert
documents to and from all of the file types it supports. Once configured,
@product@ uses this feature to convert content on the fly automatically. You can
install OpenOffice or LibreOffice on the same machine where @product@ is running
or you can connect to a separate host. 

You can start LibreOffice or OpenOffice in server mode with the following
command:

    soffice --headless --accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;"
    --nofirststartwizard

Once OpenOffice or LibreOffice is installed and running in server mode,
configure @product@ to use it either in `portal-ext.properties` or from the
Control Panel. To enable OpenOffice/LibreOffice in your `portal-ext.properties`
file, add the following line:

    openoffice.server.enabled=true

If OpenOffice or LibreOffice is running on another server or on a non-default
port, you must also specify these values. The default values are as follows:

    openoffice.server.host=127.0.0.1
    openoffice.server.port=8100

By default, when @product@ uses OpenOffice or LibreOffice to perform
conversions, it uses a cache. The first time a document is converted, a copy is
saved in the @product@ temp folder `/liferay/document_conversion/`. When
@product@ receives a conversion request, it checks this folder to see if the
converted document already exists. If the converted document is found, @product@
returns it to the user. Otherwise, it performs a fresh conversion and saves
a copy in the temp folder. 

+$$$

**Note:** Since OpenOffice functions using local server caching operating a remote instance of OpenOffice is not recommended.  Please use a local instance to prevent any limitations.

$$$


If the cache is turned off, @product@ always
regenerates the file even if a previously existing conversion already exists in
the temp folder. You can turn the cache off by setting the following property:

    openoffice.cache.enabled=false

To configure @product@ to use OpenOffice/LibreOffice from the Control Panel,
navigate to the *Server Administration* &rarr; *External Services* page and
check the *Enabled* box for OpenOffice. If OpenOffice/LibreOffice is running on
a non-default port--the default is port 8100--you must also specify the port
number.  If you have something else running on this port, find an open port and
specify it both in the command to start OpenOffice/LibreOffice in server mode
and on the Control Panel's External Services configuration page. When you are
finished, click *Save*. Now @product@ can perform many types of document
conversions.

### ImageMagick configuration [](id=imagemagick-configuration)

Before configuring ImageMagick to generate image and PDF previews, install it
and its dependency, Ghostscript. This differs by operating system: on Linux,
both are likely already installed. They are not likely to be installed on
Windows but may be on Macs.

1.  Download and install [*ImageMagick*](http://www.imagemagick.org).

2.  Download and install [*Ghostscript*](http://www.ghostscript.com).

Once installed, enable ImageMagick through the Control Panel or a
`portal-ext.properties` file. If using `portal-ext.properties`, add the
following lines and make sure the search path points to the directories
containing the ImageMagick and Ghostscript executables. You may also need to
configure the path for fonts used by Ghostscript when in Mac or Unix
environments.

    imagemagick.enabled=true
    imagemagick.global.search.path[apple]=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/share/ghostscript/fonts:/opt/local/share/fonts/urw-fonts
    imagemagick.global.search.path[unix]=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts:/usr/local/share/fonts/urw-fonts
    imagemagick.global.search.path[windows]=C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick

To enable ImageMagick from the Control Panel:

1.  Navigate to the *Server Administration* &rarr; *External Services* page. 

2.  Check *Enabled* for ImageMagick and verify the paths to the 
    ImageMagick and Ghostscript executables are correct.

Some older versions of ImageMagick don't run properly with @product@. If this is
the case, update to the latest version (ImageMagick 6.7.9-6 2012-09-25 Q16 or
later). To check for the latest ImageMagick versions, visit
[ImageMagick's website](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php).
See [LPS-30291](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-30291) for information on
efforts to identify incompatible application versions with @product@.

### Xuggler configuration [](id=xuggler-configuration)

From the control panel, navigate to the *Server Administration* &rarr; 
*External Services* page. From the dropdown, select the Xuggler `.jar` file that 
matches your operating system. Then click on *Install*. 

After installing, restart your application server and enable Xuggler for your 
portal. You can enable Xuggler either from the Control Panel or by specifying 
the portal property that enables Xuggler. 

To enable Xuggler from portal properties, add the following line to your
`portal-ext.properties` file and restart your application server. 

    xuggler.enabled=true

To enable Xuggler from the Control Panel, navigate to the *Server
Administration* &rarr; *External Services* page, check *Enabled*, and click
on *Save*.

That's it! You've successfully configured Documents and Media to use Xuggler for
audio and video files. 

## Script [](id=script)

The Script tab includes a scripting console for executing migration or
management code. The Groovy scripting language is supported out of the box. For
more information, see the 
[Scripting article](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-liferays-script-engine)
for more information on how to use the scripting console and examples.

## Shutdown [](id=shutdown)

If you ever need to shut down your @product@ server while users are logged in,
you can use the Shutdown tab to inform your logged-in users of the impending
shutdown. You can define the number of minutes until the shutdown and a custom
message to display.

@product@ displays the message at the top of users' pages for the duration of
time you specified. When the time expires, all pages display a message saying
the portal has been shut down. At this point, the server must be restarted to
restore access. 

Next, let's examine how to manage multiple portal instances.
