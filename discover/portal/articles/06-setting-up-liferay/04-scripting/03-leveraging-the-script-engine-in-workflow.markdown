# Leveraging the Script Engine in Workflow [](id=leveraging-the-script-engine-in-workflow)

Liferay's Kaleo workflow engine provides a robust system for reviewing and
approving content in an enterprise environment. Even if you don't leverage
custom scripts, it's a powerful and robust workflow solution. Adding custom
scripts takes it to the next level.

Examine the default single approver workflow definition file included with Kaleo
for an overview of how the feature works. You can find the default single
approver workflow definition file in Liferay's source code here:
[hhttps://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-portal-workflow/tree/7.0.x/portal-workflow-kaleo-runtime-impl/src/main/resources/META-INF/definitions/single-approver-definition.xml](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-portal-workflow/tree/7.0.x/portal-workflow-kaleo-runtime-impl/src/main/resources/META-INF/definitions/single-approver-definition.xml).
The final step in the workflow runs a script that makes content available for
use. As you can see in the snippet below, it uses JavaScript to access the Java
class associated with the workflow to set the status of the content to
*approved*.

    <script>
        <![CDATA[
            Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.updateStatus(Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.toStatus("denied"), workflowContext);
            Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowStatusManagerUtil.updateStatus(Packages.com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.toStatus("pending"), workflowContext);
        ]]>
    </script>
    <script-language>javascript</script-language>

At virtually any point in a workflow, you can use Liferay's script engine to
access workflow APIs or other Liferay APIs. There are a lot of different ways
you could use this. Here are a few practical examples:

- Getting a list of users with a specific workflow-related role
- Sending an email to the designated content approver with a list of people to
  contact if he is unable to review the content
- Creating an alert to be displayed in the Alerts portlet for any user assigned
  to approve content

Of course, before you try any of this, you need to know the appropriate syntax
for inserting a script into a workflow. In an XML workflow definition, a script
can be used in any XML type that can contain an *actions* tag: those types are
`<state>`, `<task>`, `<fork>` and `<join>`. Inside of one of those types, format
your script like this:

    <actions>
        <action>
            <script>
                <![CDATA[*the contents of your script*]]>
            </script>
            <script-language>*your scripting language of choice*</script-language>
        </action>
        ...
    </actions>

Here's an example of a workflow script created in Groovy. This one is designed
to be used with a `Condition` statement in Kaleo. It accesses Liferay's asset
framework to determine the category of an asset in the workflow. The script uses
the category to automatically determine the correct approval process. If the
category `legal` has been applied to the asset, the asset is sent to the `Legal
Review` task upon submission. Otherwise, the asset is sent to the `Default
Review` task.

    <script>
        <![CDATA[
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.util.GetterUtil;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandler;
            import com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetCategory;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetEntry;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetRenderer;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.model.AssetRendererFactory;
            import com.liferay.portlet.asset.service.AssetEntryLocalServiceUtil;

            import java.util.List;

            String className = (String)workflowContext.get(
                WorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_ENTRY_CLASS_NAME);

            WorkflowHandler workflowHandler =
                WorkflowHandlerRegistryUtil.getWorkflowHandler(className);

            AssetRendererFactory assetRendererFactory =
                workflowHandler.getAssetRendererFactory();

            long classPK =
                GetterUtil.getLong((String)workflowContext.get
                (WorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_ENTRY_CLASS_PK));

            AssetRenderer assetRenderer =
                workflowHandler.getAssetRenderer(classPK);

            AssetEntry assetEntry = assetRendererFactory.getAssetEntry(
                assetRendererFactory.getClassName(), assetRenderer.getClassPK());

            List<AssetCategory> assetCategories = assetEntry.getCategories();

            returnValue = "Default Review";

            for (AssetCategory assetCategory : assetCategories) {
                String categoryName = assetCategory.getName();

                if (categoryName.equals("legal")) {
                    returnValue = "Legal Review";

                    return;
                }
            }
           ]]>
    </script>
    <script-language>groovy</script-language>

Within a workflow, the next task or state is chosen based on the return value.
For a complete example of a workflow script that uses the above Groovy script,
please see this `legal-workflow-script.xml` file:
[https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/6.2.x/userGuide/code/legal-workflow-script.xml](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/6.2.x/userGuide/code/legal-workflow-script.xml).

The combination of Liferay's script and workflow engines is incredibly
powerful. However, since it provides users with the ability to execute code, it
can be dangerous. When configuring your permissions, be aware of the potential
consequences of poorly, or maliciously, written scripts inside of a workflow
definition. For more information on creating workflow definitions with Kaleo
workflow, see Liferay's
[workflow documentation (not yet written)]().
