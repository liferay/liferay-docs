# Product Categories

Products can be organized into *Categories*. These groupings allow multiple
products to be handled as a single unit. For example, a product category could
be used to apply discounts or other offers to a set of products, to assist
buyers in finding products, or to promote certain products to a specified user
segment.

To organize products into categories, you must create the categories first and
then assign products to them.

## Creating Categories

To create vocabularies, categories and subcategories, go to *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Content* &rarr; *Categories*. To learn more about the process, go to the
[Defining Categories for
Content](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories#defining-categories-for-content)
section.

Note: Categories are designed to be nested into a hierarchy. While this allows
multiple categories to be grouped together and handled as a single unit, it
also makes it difficult for administrators to see the entire vocabulary. To
view all categories at once, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration*
&rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Assets* and select *Flattened Tree* from the
drop-down menu in *Asset Categories Web*. Then return to *Site Menu* &rarr;
*Content* &rarr; *Categories*.

## Adding and Removing Products from Categories

To add a product to one or more categories:

1.  Go to the catalog, select a product, and open its *Categorization* tab.

2.  Click on the *Select* button under the label for the appropriate vocabulary,
    and in the pop-up that appears the check the box next to each category that
    applies.

3.  Click Save.

A product can be removed from a category the same way by unchecking the boxes in
step 2. Alternatively, several products can be removed at once using the category
application:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *Products* tab.

2.  Check the box next to each product you want to remove from the category.

3.  Click *Remove*.

## Other Category Associations 

You may want to associate more than just products with your categories. Creating
relationships with pages and images can make it easier to display and maintain
category content.

### Category Display Page

The category display page is a feature that creates a relationship between
a category and a specified page. This relationship makes it easy to display and
organize content or applications related to to that category, as changes made
to the category will be automatically reflected on the page. A typical use case
might involve using the page to display category content for customers.

To create a category display page:

1.  Create a page.

2.  Find the category you want to associate with the page in *Site Menu* &rarr;
    *Content* &rarr; *Categories*. Then click
    ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*, and select the
    Category Display Page tab. 

3.  Click *Choose* and select the page you just created.

4.  Click *Done* to close the pop-up and then click *Save*.

This process creates a relationship between the category and a blank page. At
any point, you can populate the page with whatever content or applications suit
your purposes.

### Images

You may want to upload images and associate them with a product category. These
images can be displayed on a category display page, on the display pages for
products that are assigned to the category, or anywhere else you want to display
category content.

To assign images to a category:

1.  Find the category you want at *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr;
    *Categories*. Then click ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)
    &rarr; *Edit*, and select the *images* tab.

2.  Click on the [Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button and make selections
    from the pop-up to either upload an image or choose one from the Documents
    and Media Repository.

3.  Click *Save*.
