# Running Scripts From the Script Console [](id=running-scripts-from-the-script-console)

To see a very simple example of the script console in action, log into the
portal as an administrator and navigate to the *Control Panel* &rarr; *Server
Administration* area of the Control Panel. Then click on *Script*. This is
@product@'s script console. Change the script type to *Groovy* and replace the
code in the script console with the following: 

    number = com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount(); 
    out.println(number); 

Click the *Execute* button and check the script console or the log for the
output.

Next, consider a less simplistic example. You'll retrieve some user information
from the database, make some changes, and then save those changes to Liferay's
database. Suppose that your company has updated the terms of use and wants each
user to be presented with the updated terms of use whenever they next log in.
When users agree to the terms of use, a boolean attribute called
`agreedToTermsOfUse` is set in their user records. As long as the value of this
variable is `true`, @product@ will not present the user with the terms of use.
However, if you set this flag to `false` for each user, each user must agree to
the terms of use again before they can log in. 

You'll use Groovy again. Ensure that the script type in the script console is set
to Groovy. Then execute the following code to check the status of the
`agreedToTermsOfUse` user attribute:

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.UserLocalServiceUtil

    userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount()
    users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount)

    for (user in users) { println("User Name: " + user.getFullName() + " -- " +
    user.getAgreedToTermsOfUse()) }

The code above just prints the value of the `agreedToTermsOfUse` attribute for
each user. Next, you'll actually update each user in the system to set his or
her `agreedToTermsOfUse` attribute to `false`. Your script will make sure to
skip the default user as well as the default admin user that's currently logged
in and running the script. If you're logged in as someone other than
test@liferay.com, make sure to update the following script before running it. 

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.UserLocalServiceUtil

    userCount = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount()
    users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(0, userCount)

    for (user in users){
    
        if(!user.isDefaultUser() && 
            !user.getEmailAddress().equalsIgnoreCase("test@liferay.com")) {
            
                user.setAgreedToTermsOfUse(false)
                UserLocalServiceUtil.updateUser(user)
        
        }
        
    }
 
To verify the script has updated the records, run the first script again and you
should see that all users (except the default user and your user) have been
updated. 

That's all that's needed to run scripts and to access the Liferay service layer.
For an example of a script that accesses OSGi services from Liferay's module
framework, please see
[Using Custom Java Tools in the Script Engine](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-custom-java-tools-in-the-script-engine).
There are, however, some things to keep in mind when working with the script
console: 

- There is no undo.
- There is no preview.
- When invoking local services, no permissions checking is enforced.
- Scripts are executed synchronously. Be careful with scripts that might take a
  long time to execute. 

For these reasons, you should use the script console cautiously. It's best to
test run your scripts on non-production systems before running them on
production. Follow the tips in the subsequent sections to make better use of
Liferay's script console. Note: These tips originated from this Liferay blog
post:
[https://www.liferay.com/web/sebastien.lemarchand/blog/-/blogs/5-tips-to-improve-usage-of-the-liferay-script-console](https://www.liferay.com/web/sebastien.lemarchand/blog/-/blogs/5-tips-to-improve-usage-of-the-liferay-script-console).
The following scripts are Groovy scripts but they can be adapted to other
languages.

## Tip 1: Use the Predefined Variables [](id=tip-1-use-the-predefined-variables)

The following predefined variables are available to scripts executed from
Liferay's script console:

- `out` (`java.io.PrintWriter`)
- `actionRequest` (`javax.portlet.ActionRequest`)
- `actionResponse` (`javax.portlet.ActionReponse`)
- `portletConfig` (`javax.portlet.PortletConfig`)
- `portletContext` (`javax.portlet.PortletContext`)
- `preferences` (`javax.portlet.PortletPreferences`)
- `userInfo` (`java.util.Map<String, String>`)

Note that if you use `System.out.println`, for example, your output will be
printed to Liferay's log file. If you use `out.println` instead (using the
predefined variable), your output will be printed to the script console.

The predefined variables can all be very useful when you're creating scripts.
The `actionRequest` variable can be especially useful, as this script
demonstrates:

    import com.liferay.portal.util.*

    company = PortalUtil.getCompany(actionRequest)
    out.println("Current company: ${company.getName()}\n")

    out.println("User info:")
    userInfo.each{ 
            k, v -> out.println("${k}:${v}") 
    }

![Figure 1: Here's an example of invoking a Groovy script that uses the predefined `out`, `actionRequest`, and `userInfo` variables to print information about the current user.](../../../images/groovy-script-current-user-info.png)

## Tip 2: Embed HTML Markup in Script Outputs [](id=tip-2-embed-html-markup-in-script-outputs)

The output of the script console is rendered as HTML content. Thus, you can
embed HTML markup in your outputs to change their look and feel. Here's an
example:

    import com.liferay.portal.service.*

    number = com.liferay.portal.service.UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsersCount();
    out.println(
            """	
                    <div style="background-color:black; text-align: center">
                            <h1 style="color: #37A9CC; font-size:xx-large">${number}</h1>
                    </div>
            """);

![Figure 2: Here's an example of invoking a Groovy script that embeds HTML markup in the output of the script.](../../../images/groovy-script-embed-html-markup.png)

## Tip 3: Show Exceptions in the Script Console [](id=tip-3-show-exceptions-in-the-script-console)

When any exception occurs during script execution, the error message is always
the same:

    Your request failed to complete.

This message gives no detail about the error. To find information about the
error and what caused it, you usually need to examine the server logs.

However, you can use the following technique to make exception details appear in
the script console. Wrap your code with a try / catch block and print the stack
trace to the console output from the catch clause. Note that even this technique
does not catch script syntax errors. Here's an example:

    try {
            nullVar = null
            out.println(nullVar.length())
    } catch(e) {
            out.println("""<div class="portlet-msg-error">${e}</div>""")
            e.printStackTrace(out)
    }

![Figure 3: Here's an example of a Groovy script that catches exceptions and prints exception information to the script console.](../../../images/groovy-script-show-exception.png)

## Tip 4: Implement a Preview Mode [](id=tip-4-implement-a-preview-mode)

Since Liferay's script console does not provide an undo feature, it can be very
convenient to set up a kind of preview mode. The purpose of a preview mode is to
determine any permanent effects of a script before any information is actually
saved to the Liferay database. The preview mode consists in using a
`previewMode` flag which determines whether the operations with permanent
effects should be executed or not. If `previewMode` is `true`, all of the data
which would be permanently affected by the script is systematically printed.
This providers the user executing the script with an outline of the data
impacted by the script. If the user determines that everything is OK, the flag
can be switched so that the script can make permanent updates to the database.

Here's an example Groovy script that show the preview mode concept in action:

    import java.util.Calendar
    import com.liferay.portal.service.*
    import com.liferay.portal.model.*
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.*
    import static com.liferay.portal.kernel.workflow.WorkflowConstants.*

    //
    // Deactivate users never logged and created since more than 2 years
    //

    previewMode = true // Update this flag to false to really make changes

    Calendar twoYearsAgo = Calendar.getInstance()
    twoYearsAgo.setTime(new Date())
    twoYearsAgo.add(Calendar.YEAR, -2)

    DynamicQuery query = DynamicQueryFactoryUtil.forClass(User.class)
            .add(PropertyFactoryUtil.forName("lastLoginDate").isNull())
            .add(PropertyFactoryUtil.forName("createDate").lt(twoYearsAgo.getTime()))

    users = UserLocalServiceUtil.dynamicQuery(query)

    users.each { u ->
             if(!u.isDefaultUser() && u.getStatus() != STATUS_INACTIVE) {
                    out.println(u.getEmailAddress())
                    if(!previewMode) {
                            UserLocalServiceUtil.updateStatus(u.getUserId(), STATUS_INACTIVE)
                    }
             }
    }

    if(previewMode) {
            out.println('Preview mode is on: switch off the flag and execute '
                    + 'again this script to make changes to the database') 
    }

## Tip 5: Plan a File Output for Long-Running Scripts [](id=tip-5-plan-a-file-output-for-long-running-scripts)

When a script has been running for a long time, it's possible for the script
console to return an error even though the script can continue running and
potentially conclude successfully. But it's impossible to know the outcome
without the corresponding output!

To bypass this limitation, you can send the output of the script console to a
custom file instead of to the console itself or to the Liferay log. For example,
consider this script:

    import com.liferay.portal.service.*
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.dao.orm.*

    // Output management

    final def SCRIPT_ID = "MYSCRIPT"
    outputFile = new File("""${System.getProperty("liferay.home")}/scripting/out-${SCRIPT_ID}.txt""")
    outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs()

    def trace(message) {
            out.println(message)
            outputFile << "${message}\n"
    }

    // Main code

    users = UserLocalServiceUtil.getUsers(QueryUtil.ALL_POS, QueryUtil.ALL_POS)
    users.each { u ->
            trace(u.getFullName())
    } 

The script above creates a subfolder of Liferay Home called `scripting` and
saves the script output to a file in this folder. After running the script
above, it's possible to read the generated file without direct access to the
file system. Here's a second script that demonstrates this:

    final def SCRIPT_ID = "MYSCRIPT"
    outputFile = new File("""${System.getProperty("liferay.home")}/scripting/out-${SCRIPT_ID}.txt""")
    out.println(outputFile.text)

One advantage of using a dedicated output file instead of using a classic logger
is that it's easier to get the script output data back. Getting the script
output data would be more difficult to obtain from the portal log, for example,
because of all the other information there.

Of course, Liferay's script engine has uses beyond the script console. Next,
you'll learn how to leverage Liferay's script engine for designing workflows.
