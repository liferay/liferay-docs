# Widget Permissions [](id=widget-permissions)

All of Liferay's widgets support @product@'s robust, fine-grained permissions
system. Some higher level permissions can be configured in the permissions tab
of the widget's configuration dialog box. You can grant Roles permission to

- Add a display template
- Add the widget to a page
- Configure the app
- Modify the widget's permissions
- Modify the widget's preferences
- View the widget

To set these permissions, go to the widget's *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) and click select *Permissions*.
This shows you a table of Roles. Use the check boxes to grant certain
permissions to different Roles. Click *Save* after you've made your selections.

Beyond this, specific permissions are generally defined for specific
widgets. For example, Message Boards contains a *Ban User* permission. 
This makes no sense in the context of most other widgets. 
You'll go over permissions for specific widgets in the sections for those 
widgets. Next, you'll learn about widget scopes.
