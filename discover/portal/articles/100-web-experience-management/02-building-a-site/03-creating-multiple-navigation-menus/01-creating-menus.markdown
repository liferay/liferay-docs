# Creating and Managing Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-navigation-menus)

Navigation menus can be created for a number of reasons. In some cases, you 
might want to display a different top level navigation on different pages of 
the same site. In other cases, you might need a second level menu which 
provides additional navigation options on a specific page. To better understand 
Navigation Menus, it's time to create a new menu which uses a number of 
features.

## Creating a Navigation Menu [](id=creating-a-navigation-menu)

To get started with Navigation Menus:

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Navigation Menus*.

2.  Click on the `+` button to add a new menu.

3.  Give your menu a name and click *Submit*.

On the next page, you're presented with a number of elements that you can add 
to a menu.

**Page**: Select an existing page from the current site to add to the navigation
menu.

**Submenu**: Use this to create a second level of menu navigation.

**URL**: Create a link to any page outside of the current site or portal with
a URL link, which appears just like any other option in your menu.
 
Click on *Page* and you see a view of all the current pages on the current site.
Select a page and click *Add* to add that page to the menu.

the page again.

2.  Select *Submenu* in the menu that pops up.

3.  Name your menu "External Links".

name and URL.

the submenu.

## Managing Menus [](id=managing-menus)

After you create a menu, more configuration options appear on the main
Navigation Menus page. 

**Title**: Your menu's name. 

**Add New Pages**: Determines if new pages added to the main navigation are
added to the menu automatically. 

**Marked As**: Can be set as *Primary Navigation*, *Secondary Navigation*, or
*Social Navigation*.
 
**Author**: The user that created the menu.

**Create Date**: When the menu was created.

The menu types are used primarily for theme and fragment developers to 
determine how a menu should be styled. **Primary Navigation** is for the main
navigation for a page. **Secondary Navigation** is for a second level of
navigation, possibly a side bar or a separate menu within a page. **Social
Navigation** is for menus that containing links for sharing content on social
media or similar tasks.
