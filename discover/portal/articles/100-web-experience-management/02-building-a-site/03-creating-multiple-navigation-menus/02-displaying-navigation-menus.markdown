# Displaying Navigation Menus

After you have created Navigation Menus, you can display them in different ways
on your site. You may want to configure different menus and display styles for things like a main menu, sidebar, and footer menu all on one pages.

## The Navigation Menu Widget

With the Navigation Menu widget, you can add navigation all over your site, but 
you probably want to be pretty judicious about how you do that. You can place 
the widget on a page and then select a menu and style for the menu you are 
displaying.

To use the Navigation Menu:

1.  Go to a Widget Page, open the Add menu on the right side of the page and 
    add the *Content Management* &rarr; *Navigation Menu* to the page.

2.  Open the *Configuration* menu.

From here there are three main categories that you can configure.

-  The Navigation Menu to be displayed

-  The styling of the menu

-  What level of navigation to display

### Choosing a Navigation Menu

The Navigation Menu Widget has two ways to select a menu. You can choose to 
*Select Navigation* or *Choose Menu*.

*   **Select Navigation** will allow you to select from the three main menu 
    types: *Primary Navigation*, *Secondary Navigation*, and *Social Navigation* which you could choose when you created a menu.

*   **Choose Menu** which lets you choose any menu that has been created for 
    that site.
    
Once you select a menu, you need to choose how to display it.

### Display Template

The *Display Template* option lets you select an [Application Display Template](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/application-display-templates) 
which has been predefined for Navigation Menus. There ten included by default:

-  **List Menu** displays all the items in a vertical list.
-  **Pills Horizontal** displays the items horizontally and uses a button style
    for highlighting.
-  **Pills Justified** is the same as Pills Horizontal, but it will pad the
    items to fill out the horizontal space.
-  **Pills Stacked** is a vertical version of the "pills" style.
-  **Tabs** displays the items like standard navigation tabs.
-  **Tabs Justified** uses the navigation tabs while filling horizontal space.
-  **Bar minimally styled** is a light weight version of the default display 
    that you see in the embedded menu on your page.
-  **Bar minimally justified styled** is the same as Bar minimally styled with
    horizontal padding.
-  **Bar default styled** is the default that you see in the embedded menu.
-  **Split Button Dropdowns** displays each item as a button with a dropdown 
    for multiple nav levels.

You can also add your own custom templates.

### Menu Items to Show

The *Menu Items to Show* section provided options to configure which pages at 
what level from the menu are displayed in the widget. It provides options for 
what level to start at, how many levels deep to display and how to display 
sublevels.

-  **Start with Menu Items In** allows you to choose whether you're starting at 
    a specific level of the navigation or a level relative to the current level 
    (whether above or below).

-  **Sublevels to Display** lets you select any number of levels to display in the navigation, from **1** down to **Infinite**.

-  **Expand Sublevels** determines whether hovering you mouse over the 
    navigation will reveal navigation levels one at a time automatically, or 
    will just reveal all the levels all at once.
    
## Using Navigation Menus

Now you can see how there are a variety of customizations and configurations available for navigation menus that you can implement for your site.
