# Page Set Look and Feel

Page Set configuration starts with the *Look and Feel* tab. Here you have an 
interface for choosing a theme for the current site.

## Themes

Themes can transform the entire look of the portal. They are created by 
developers and are easily installed using the Liferay Marketplace.

You can apply themes to individual pages as well by selecting *Configure*
&rarr; *Define a specific look and feel for this page* option under the page's
*Look and Feel* category.

Many themes include more than one color scheme, which keeps the existing look
and feel while giving the site a different flavor. The Color Schemes option
is not available for the default theme.

There are a few more configurable settings for your theme. You can switch the
bullet style between dots and arrows and you can choose whether or not to show
maximize/minimize application links by default. The *CSS* section has an editor
for custom CSS for tweaking your theme. 


## Using a Custom Logo for a Site [](id=using-a-custom-logo-for-a-site)

By default, the Liferay logo is used for your site pages' logo. If you want to
use your own logo for a specific site, use the *Logo* tab. Adding a custom logo
is easy: select the *Logo* tab from the *Configure* interface and browse
to the location of your logo. Make sure your logo fits the space in the top left
corner of the theme you're using for your web site. If you don't, you could wind
up with a site that's difficult to navigate, as other page elements are pushed
aside to make way for the logo.

In the logo tab, you can also choose whether or not to display the site name on
the site. If you check the box labeled *Show Site Name*, the site name appears
next to the logo. This option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled if
the *Allow Site Administrators to set their own logo* option is disabled in
*Instance Settings*. Removing the site name is not available for the default
site--you can configure this only for new sites and user pages.
