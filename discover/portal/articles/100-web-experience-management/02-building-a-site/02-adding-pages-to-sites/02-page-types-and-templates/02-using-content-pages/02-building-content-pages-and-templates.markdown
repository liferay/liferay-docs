# Building Content Pages from Fragments [](id=building-content-pages-from-fragments)

After the Page Fragment collections that you need are published, you are ready 
to create Page Templates.  The Page Template will be composed of some number of 
Fragments - it could be one or it could be fifty.

## Creating a Page Template [](id=creating-a-page-template)

You create Page Templates in the *Pages* page in Site Administration.

1.  From Site Administation for your site, go to *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Select the Page Templates tab.

Like Fragments, Content Page Templates must be created in Collections. You see 
all of your current Collections at the root of the Page Templates page. 
Collections will also enable you to quickly select templates when creating 
pages. Next you want to create a Page Template.

1.  Click the `+` icon to *Add Collection*.

2.  *Name* your Collection, provide a *Description*, and click *Save*.

3.  Click on the new Collection.

4.  Click the *Add* icon (![Add Page Template](../../../../../../images/icon-add.png)) from inside of the 
    Collection to *Add Page Template*.

5.  Set the *Name* and click *Submit*.

Now you're on the Page Template creation page. Fragments are added by selecting 
a Collection from the *Fragments* tab on the right and adding them to the page. 
You can add multiple Fragments from different collections, and you can add the 
same Fragment to the page multiple times. To see which Fragments the current 
page is made up of, you can check the *Added* tab. The template is 
automatically saved as you work.

If the template contains editable text, you can click on the editable text area to change the text.

If the template contains an editable image, you can click on the image and 
replace it by either uploading your own image, or selecting one from Documents 
and Media.

Note: During the process of creating Page Templates you can make changes to editable Fragments, and in the process of creating the final Content Page, you can make changes to the Page Template. Any changes you make to the Fragment for a Page Template are only reflected in that specific Page Template, and won't effect the Fragment itself. Likewise, when you apply edits to the text or images of a Content Page, those changes will only exist on the current page that you're working on, and not on the Page Template itself.

Click on the back arrow at the top to stop editing the template.

## Creating a Content Page [](id=creating-a-content-page)

After you are done creating a Page Template you can use that template to create 
a Content Page. A Content Page is basically a page created from Fragments. Any 
aspects of the page that were defined by the developer as editable can be 
edited during the creation of the page or page template.

1.  Go back to the main *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* page.

2.  Click the `+` button for *Add Page*.

3.  Click on the tab for the Collection which contains the template you want to 
    use.

3.  Enter a *Name*.

4.  Click Save.

Alternatively, you can select the page type first, and then the template. After you click the `+` to add a page do the following:

1.  Select the *Basic Pages* tab.

2.  Select *Content*.

3.  Choose the *Page Template* you want to use from the selector.

4.  Click *Add Page*
    
By default, your new page will be added to the Navigation Menu and users can 
access the page you created. Next you'll learn how to import and export 
Page Fragments.
