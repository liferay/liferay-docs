# Creating Widget Pages

Widget Pages are what you might think of as the standard type of page in 
@product@. They're simple to create and fill with content or functionality. You 
create a blank page, define a layout, and then add widgets to the layout. Those 
widgets could be for displaying content or for providing some tool or function 
for the user.

## Adding a Widget Page

When you first start @product@ you get a widget page for free as your front 
page. To create a new widget page, do the following:

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click the `+` button in the top right to add a new page.

3.  Select the *Widget Page* type.

4.  Name the page "Community" and leave the box checked to *Add this Page to the
    following Menus: Default*.
    
5.  Click *Submit*.
    
6.  On the next screen you can select a Layout Template or manage other options.
    Leave the defaults and click *Save*.

Creating a page, by default, also adds it to any Navigation Menus that are 
configured to have new pages added to them. If you don't want a new page added 
to a specific Navigation Menu that is listed during page creation, uncheck the 
box for that menu.

Your new page is now added to the navigation.

1.  Click the logo in the top left of the page to go back to your site's front 
    page. You will see the page you just created in the main navigation now.
    
2.  Click on *Community* to go to the page.

Currently the page is empty. Next you'll add some widgets to give it functionality.

## Adding Widgets to a Page

To add widget to a page, go to the page and click the *Add* button  
(![Add](../../../../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) 
from the  top menu and select the *Widgets* tab. You can either browse
through the categories of available widgets until you find the one you want, or 
you can search for widgets by name. Once you've found an widget, click the 
*Add* button to add it to the current page. Once there, you can drag it to a 
new position. Alternatively, you can drag the widget directly from the Widgets 
menu to a specific location on the page. Follow the steps below to add some
Collaboration apps to the Lunar Resort site.

1.  From the top menu, select *Add* &rarr; *Widgets*.

2.  In the menu that appears, expand the *Collaboration* category.

3.  Drag the *Blogs Aggregator* app from the Add Application window to the right
    column of your page.

4.  Next, drag the *Wiki* app to the left column.

See how easy it is to add applications to your pages? You've added the Wiki
app and Blogs Aggregator app to a page.

If the default layout options provided aren't enough, you can even develop your
own. For more information about developing custom layout templates, see the
tutorial 
[Layout Templates with the Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-layout-templates-with-the-themes-generator-0). 

Next, you'll look at creating reusable templates for widget pages.
