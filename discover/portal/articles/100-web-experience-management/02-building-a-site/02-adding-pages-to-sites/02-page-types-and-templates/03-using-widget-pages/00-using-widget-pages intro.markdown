# Using Widget Pages [](id=adding-applications-to-a-page)

While sometimes you might want to meticulously construct a design with your 
page using Content Page tools, other times, you'll need the flexibility and
dynamicism of Widget Pages.  Widget Pages are composed of "widgets." A widget 
is any application that you can add to a page. Widget Pages are constructed by 
adding widgets to the page and filling them with content.

A widget could be a wiki display or a dynamic publishing tool like the Asset 
Publisher. The content you display with widgets could be longform text, or it 
could be an image gallery. Virtually any page that you can imagine---you can do 
it with widgets. In this section, you'll learn to create widget pages and build
content with them.
