# Setting a Default ADT [](id=setting-a-default-adt)

You can change the ADT for an individual widget through its own configuration, 
but to configure the default ADT for all widgets of that type, you need to go 
to **System Settings**. In the System Settings you can find a specific 
configuration for every widget in Liferay. Any widget that supports ADTs will 
have a *Display Style Group ID* and a *Display Style* option.

![Figure 1: Here is the ADT configuration in System Settings..](../../../../../images/adt-system-settings.png)


- **Display Style Group ID:** The site ID where the ADT is located. For Global
    templates use *0* for the ID.
 
- **Display Style:** The template key for the 

To enter a Display Style, you first need the **Template Key** for the template
you want to use. To get the Template Key, go to the *Application Display 
Template* list for a given site, and retrieve it from the ADT listing. Then,
enter the display style as `"ddmTemplate_[template-key]"`.

## Default ADT Example [](id=default-adt-example)

For example, Configure the Language Selector ADTs like this:

1.  Open the *Menu*.

2.  Using the *Site Selector*, select the *Global* site.

3.  Go to *Build* &rarr; *Application Display Templates*

4.  Find the *Icon* *Language Selector Template* and click on it.

5.  Open *Details* and find the *Template Key* - `LANGUAGE-ICON-FTL`

![Figure 2: This is where you can find the Template Key.](../../../../../images/adt-system-settings.png)

Now that you have the ID, you can change the template from System Settings.

1.  Once you have the ID, go to the *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings* 

2.  Find *Localization* under the *Platform* heading, and select *Language 
    Selector* from the options on the left.
    
3.  In the *Display Style* field, enter `ddmTemplate_LANGUAGE-ICON-FTL`.
    
Now any Language Selector widgets that are added to a page will use the new 
defaults. This will not effect widgets that have already been added to a page
or already configured.
