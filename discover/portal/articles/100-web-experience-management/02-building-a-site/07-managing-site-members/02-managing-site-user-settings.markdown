# Managing Site Settings for Members [](id=managing-site-settings-for-members)

You've already covered the basics of managing Site Memberships and Roles, now you'll look at some key configuration options for managing members of your Site.

1.  Open the *Product Menu* and use the site selector to choose the site you 
    want to configure.

2.  In Site Administration, go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Site Settings*.


## Details [](id=details)

*Details* is the leading option under the General tab, which provides
the same menu you filled out when first creating your Lunar Resort site. This
allows an administrator to change the description and membership type of a site.
The membership type can be set as open, restricted, or private based on the
privacy needs of the site. Users can join and leave an open site at will. To
join a restricted site, a user has to be added by the site administrator. A user
can also request to be added through the Sites section of the Control Panel. A
private site is like a restricted site but doesn't appear in the Sites section
of the Control Panel for users who aren't members.

You also have the ability to organize sites into hierarchies. At the bottom of
the Details sub-section is the Parent Site section. This feature allows you to
select the parent site for the site you're currently on. After selecting a
parent site, you have a checkbox option to limit membership to members of the
parent site.

## Default User Associations [](id=default-user-associations)

Once you have the basic details of your site saved, you can begin assigning your
users to roles and teams. Still inside of *Site Settings*, go to the 
*Advanced* section. *Default User Associations*, the leading option when
opening the Advanced tab, lets you configure site roles and teams that newly
assigned site members will have by default. If you'd like to learn more about
creating roles, visit the
[Roles and Permissions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions)
section.

## Ratings and Mentions [](id=ratings)

Next, open the *Social* section of *Site Administration*. From the *Ratings* section you can enable ratings for applications like Documents and Media, Web Content, Comments, etc. You can also select ratings types like Stars, Likes, and Thumbs.

The last configuration option in Site Settings related to managing users is
*Mentions*. *Mentions* is found under the Social tab. This option allows you to
enable/disable the Mentioning functionality, which is used to *mention* (notify
and/or draw attention to) friends and colleagues by entering the "@" character
followed by their user name. You can learn more about the mentioning feature by
visiting the
[Mentioning Users](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/mentioning-users)
article.

Now that you're aware of your Site Settings abilities to improve User and
Content management, you'll learn about Teams in the next section.
