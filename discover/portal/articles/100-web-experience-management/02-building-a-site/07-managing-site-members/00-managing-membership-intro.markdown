# Managing Members in Your Site [](id=managing-members-in-your-site)

Users and Sites are important concepts. Sites are were all of your content and 
pages are stored, and users are the ones who are  accessing and creating that 
content. While user management is covered in depth in our [User Management tutorial](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions),
there are other user configuration options that are specific to Site Management.

You can configure social options that enable users to interact with content, as 
well as organizing and empowering users using **Default User Associations** and 
**Teams***. In this section you'll learn to manage and configure these site 
options for users.
