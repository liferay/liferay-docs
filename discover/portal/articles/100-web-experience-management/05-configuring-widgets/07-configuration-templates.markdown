# Configuration Templates [](id=configuration-templates)

Once you've configured a widget, Configuration Templates enable you to
save those settings in a reusable template. If someone goes in and changes the
settings of a particular widget, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back to the original configuration template. Configuration templates are only
available for widgets placed on a page. Applications available from the Product Menu do not provide configuration templates.

To create a configuration template, click the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the menu in the app's title
bar and select *Configuration Templates*. If the current settings of the widget
you're configuring are the ones you want to save, click the *Save Current
Configuration as Template* button. If not, change the settings of your app until
it's configured the way you want it, and then click the button.

There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click
*Save*. You should now see your configuration in the list. If you ever need to revert the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions*
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the
configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the widgets in @product@ support this feature. 
This is particularly useful for widgets that have a lot of configuration 
options, such as the Message Boards application. 

In this chapter, you've explored the configuration options available for Liferay
widgets. You learned how to customize your widgets, export/import
data, communicate between widgets, take advantage of different scopes, and save
configuration settings. You also examined the different uses of social applications like Facebook and Netvibes for your Liferay widgets. In
all, @product@ gives you an abundance of options to leverage the full capability
of your widgets.
