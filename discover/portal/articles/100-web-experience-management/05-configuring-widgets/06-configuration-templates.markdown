# Configuration Templates [](id=configuration-templates)

Once you've configured a widget, Configuration Templates can save those
settings in a reusable template. If someone goes in and changes the settings of
a particular widget, it then becomes easy to revert those changes back to the
original configuration template. Configuration templates are only available for
widgets placed on a page. Applications available from the Product Menu do not
provide configuration templates.

To create a configuration template, click the *Options* icon
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the menu in the widget's
title bar and select *Configuration Templates*. If widget's current settings
are the ones you want to save, click the *Save Current Configuration as
Template* button. If not, change the settings until it's configured the way you
want it, and then click the button.

There is only one field to fill out. Enter a name for your template and click
*Save*. You should now see your configuration in the list. If you ever need to
revert the app to these archived settings, you can click *Actions*
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Apply* next to the
configuration template you want to apply.

Unless otherwise noted, all widgets in @product@ support this feature. This is
particularly useful for widgets that have a lot of configuration options, such
as the Message Boards application.
