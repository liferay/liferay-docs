# Configuring Widgets [](id=configuring-applications)

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
widgets that ship with @product@ also share common features. These include
look and feel, exporting/importing app data, communication, sharing,
permissions, scoping, and configuration templates. These features work together 
to facilitate information flow within @product@ and provide an enhanced 
experience for your users. You'll start with look and feel configuration 
options.
