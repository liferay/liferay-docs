# Organizing Content with Tags and Categories [](id=organizing-content-with-tags-and-categories)

Tags and categories are two important tools you can use to help organize
information in @product@. These tools help users to easily find the content
they're looking for through search or navigation. Tagging and categorizing
assets is easy. You can tag or categorize an asset at creation time or when
editing an existing asset. If you click on the *Metadata* section of the
form when creating or editing an asset, you'll find an interface for adding tags
and categories. If no categories are available to be added to the asset (e.g.,
if no categories have been created), the *Select* option won't appear.

**Note:** You'll notice in figure 1 above that there is also a *Priority* field
for web content. This field is not related to categories and tags, but rather,
specifies the order in which the web content article is listed when displayed in
the Asset Publisher. To learn more about the Asset Publisher, see the
[Publishing Assets](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-assets)
section.

The Menu (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)) contains interfaces for
managing tags and categories for each site in @product@. Navigate to the Site
Administration menu &rarr; *Categorization*, and you'll find the *Tags* and
*Categories* options. These options can be used to manage all your site's tags
and categories. It is important that you both tag and categorize your content
when you enter it. You'll take a closer look at tags and categories next.
