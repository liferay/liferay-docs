# Tagging Content [](id=tagging-content)

Tags are an important tool that can help organize information in @product@ and
make it easier for users to find the content that they're interested in. Tags
are lowercase words or phrases that you can attach to any content on the
website. Uppercase characters in tags aren't recognized. Tagging content makes
your search results more accurate and enables you to use tools like the Asset
Publisher to display content in an organized fashion on a web page. There are
two ways to create tags: you can do it through the administrative console in the
Site Administration section of the Menu or on the fly as content is created. By
default, tags can be created by regular users and users can apply them to any
assets which they have permission to create or edit.

While regular users can, by default, create new tags by applying them to any
assets that they have permission to create or edit, only site administrators can
access the *Tags* application in the Content section of the Site Administration
area of the Menu. Here, site administrators can create new tags and edit any
existing site tags. To create tags in Site Administration:

1.  Go to the site for which you want to create tags and then click *Content 
    *&rarr; *Tags*.
    
    From this screen, you can view existing tags and create new ones.

2.  To create a new tag, click the *Add Tag* icon (![Add Tag](../../../images/icon-add.png)) and enter a name for the tag.

The process for adding tags during content creation is very similar. For
example, to create tags for a new web content article:

1.  Go to the *Metadata* dropdown in a New Web Content menu.

2.  Add tags *Lunar*, *Moon*, and *Spectacular*.

Once you've created the web content with these tags, the web content will be 
associated with those tag words when they are searched or referenced anywhere 
in @product@.

Tags are not the only instance-wide mechanism for describing content: you can
also use categories.
