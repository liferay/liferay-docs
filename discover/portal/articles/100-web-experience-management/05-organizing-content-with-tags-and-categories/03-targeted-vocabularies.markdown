# Targeted Vocabularies [](id=targeted-vocabularies)

Targeted Vocabularies allow you to decide which vocabularies can be applied to
an asset type and which vocabularies are required for an asset type. To
configure these settings, go to the Categories application in Site
Administration and select a vocabulary's *Actions* icon. Select the *Associated
Asset Types* tab to reveal a dialog box like the one below.

![Figure 4: You can target vocabularies by checking the *Allow Multiple Categories* selector and then selecting the Asset Types.](../../../images/targeted-vocabularies.png)

The default value for *Associated Asset Types* is *All Asset Types*. You can
fine tune your choices by using the *+* and *-* buttons, which narrows the scope
of the vocabulary to specific assets. In the screenshot above, notice that the
vocabulary is configured to be available for Web Content articles and Blog
entries, but it is not required. It is mandatory, however, for Bookmark entries.

## Single and Multi-valued Vocabularies [](id=single-and-multi-valued-vocabularies)

You can also decide if users can choose one or more categories from the same
vocabulary to apply to an asset. If a vocabulary is single-valued you can only
choose one. If it allows more, you can choose several categories from the
vocabulary to apply to an asset.

![Figure 5: Multi-valued vocabularies allow multiple categories from the vocabulary to be applied to an asset. Single-valued vocabularies only allow one category from the vocabulary to be applied. Here, the *Dining* and *Nightlife* categories are selected to be applied but the *Scenic Adventures* category is not.](../../../images/multi-valued-vocabularies.png)

You can configure the single-valued or multi-valued status of a vocabulary
through the Categories application. Edit a vocabulary and deselect the *Allow
Multiple Categories* selector to create a single-valued vocabulary. Use the
default option to create a multi-valued vocabulary.

## Separated Entries [](id=separated-widgets)

A third feature of vocabularies and categories is that every vocabulary has its
own separated entry. These entries appear in the Categorization section of the
form for editing an asset and they allow users to easily select appropriate
categories for that asset.

![Figure 6: Vocabularies have their own entries, making it easy to select available categories.](../../../images/separated-entries.png)

It's important to use tags and categories with all your content, so that content
is easier for users to find. Now that your content is categorized and tagged,
you'll learn how to define content relationships next.
