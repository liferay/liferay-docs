# Publishing Basic Web Content [](id=publishing-basic-web-content)

To start working with Web Content, you'll examine some basic concepts involving 
Sites and pages.

You'll start with an overview of WCM features, and then look deeper at each 
feature. Note that web content is just one kind of asset on Liferay. Other types of content (blog posts, wiki articles, message board posts, etc.) are also considered assets. @product@ provides a general framework for
handling assets that includes tags, categories, comments, ratings, and more.
Please see the [Publishing Content Dynamically](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-content-dynamically)
section for more information on Liferay's asset framework.
