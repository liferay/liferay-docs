# Creating Web Content [](id=creating-web-content)

To start you'll create some simple content using the WYSIWYG editor, and 
publish it to the home page of the Lunar Resort's web site. 

1.  Go to *Site Administration* and click the the *Site Selector* button
    (![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)).
    
    Whichever Site is selected is where the content will be created, so always
    make sure that you're working on the right Site. Content can also be created as Global so that any Site can access it.

2.  Select the *Lunar Resort* site---where you'll be working.

3.  Open the *Content* section and click on *Web Content*

    From here you can create web content, or create folders to store content 
    in. For sites with lots of content and web content articles, it can be very 
    useful to use folders to group certain kinds of web content articles 
    together. 

4.  Click *Add* (![Add Web Content](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; 
    *Basic Web Content* to create a new web content article.

    By default, *Basic Web Content* is the only article type available. You can
    create new article types with [Web Content Structures and Templates](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/designing-uniform-content).

![Figure 2: Click *Add* &rarr; *Basic Web Content* to create a new simple web content article. To create a new web content article based on an existing web content structure, click *Add* and then click on the name of the structure you'd like to use.](../../../../images/web-content-add-menu.png)

5.  Type "Welcome to the Lunar Resort" in the *Title* field.

6.  In the *Summary* field, give a short description of the Lunar Resort's facilities (be creative).

7.  In the *Content* field, add the body of your web content article, which
    you'll dive into next.

8.  Lastly, leave the *Searchable* switch enabled and click *Publish* 

    If you disable the searchability of your article, it only prevents end users
    from finding the article via search. Administrators still have the ability 
    to search for the article from the Web Content section in the Menu, and the 
    article can still be added to a page.

That's all it takes to create Web Content, but there's a lot more under the 
hood of the web content editor, and a lot more options available that you'll
learn about next.
