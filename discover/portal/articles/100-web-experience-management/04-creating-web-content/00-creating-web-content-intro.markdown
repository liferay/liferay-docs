# Introduction to Web Content [](id=introduction-web-content)

@product@'s Web Content Management (WCM) system allows non-technical users to
publish content to the web without having advanced knowledge of web technology
or development. Liferay WCM empowers you to publish content with a simple point 
and click interface. You can create, edit, and publish content within just a 
few minutes of learning its features.

To complement the basic web content, developers can create complex templates 
with dynamic elements. Once these templates have been deployed into @product@, 
your non-technical users can manage content using these templates as easily as 
they would manage basic content.

WCM isn't just an editor, it's a complete toolkit for managing content. Some of 
the available tools  are covered in other chapters of the User's Guide, so 
links are provided if you're interested in using them to manage your Site's web 
content.

- **Web Content Editor:** A complete HTML editor that allow you to modify 
    fonts, add color, insert images, and much more.

- **Structure Editor:** Define fields for structured content and more advanced
    designs.

- **Template Editor:** Import template script files or create your own template
    that informs the system how to display the content within the fields
    determined by the structure.

- **Web Content Display:** Place web content on pages in your Site.

- **Asset Publisher:** Aggregate and display different types of
    content together in one view. This app is covered in more detail in the
    [Publishing Assets](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/publishing-assets)
    section.

- **Scheduler:** Lets you schedule when content is reviewed, displayed and
    removed. This feature is covered in more detail in the
    [Scheduling Web Content Publication](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/scheduling-web-content-publication)
    section.

- **Workflow Integration:** Run your content through an approval or review
    process. This feature is covered in more detail in the
    [Using Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-workflow)
    section.

- **Staging:** Use a separate staging server or stage your content locally so
    you can keep your changes separate from the live site. This feature is 
    covered in more detail in the [Using the Staging Environment](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-staging-environment)
    section.

You have the ability to create, edit, stage, approve, and publish content with 
easy-to-learn yet powerful tools. While WCM streamlines the content 
creation process for end users it is also integrated with Liferay's services so 
advanced template developers can use them to query for data stored elsewhere on 
your website.

To demonstrate @product@'s Web Content Management features, you'll create
and manage content on Liferay for the ambitious (and fictitious) *Lunar Resort*
project. The Lunar Resort project specializes in facilitating lunar vacations.
It provides space shuttle transportation from the Earth to the Moon and back,
offers the use of a state-of-the-art recreational facility enclosed by a large,
transparent habitat dome, and even rents out lunar rovers.
