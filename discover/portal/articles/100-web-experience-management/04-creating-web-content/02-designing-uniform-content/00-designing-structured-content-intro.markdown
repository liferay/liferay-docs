# Designing Structured Content [](id=designing-uniform-content)

If you've ever launched a web site, you know that as it grows, you can
experience growing pains. This is the case especially if you've given lots of
people access to the site to make whatever changes they need to make. Without
preset limitations, users can display content in any order and in any manner
they desire (think huge, flashing letters in a font nobody can read). Content
can get stale, especially if those responsible for it don't maintain it like
they should. And sometimes, content is published that should never have seen the
light of day.

</div>

Thankfully, Liferay WCM helps you handle all of those situations. You can use
*Structures* to define which fields are available to users when they create
content. These can be coupled with *Templates* that define how to display that
content. Content won't get stale, because you can take advantage of the
[Scheduling](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/scheduling-web-content-publication)
feature to determine when content is displayed and when it's
removed. Additionally, you can configure @product@'s built-in
[Workflow](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-workflow) system to set
up a review and publishing process so only what you want winds up on the live
site. @product@ gives you the management tools you need to run everything from a
simple, one-page web site to an enormous, content-rich site.

All of this starts with structures.
