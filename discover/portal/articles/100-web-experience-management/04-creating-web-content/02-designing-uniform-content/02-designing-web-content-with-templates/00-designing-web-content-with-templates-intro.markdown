# Designing Web Content with Templates [](id=designing-web-content-with-templates)

Developers create templates to display the elements of the structure in the
markup they want. In essence, templates are scripts that tell @product@ how to 
display content in the structure. Any changes to the structure require 
corresponding changes to the template, because new or deleted fields produce 
errors on the page. A structure cannot be displayed without a template, and a
template cannot exist without a structure.

@product@ supports creating web content templates in Freemarker (FTL), Velocity 
(VM), and XSL format. Freemarker is the preferred, recommended language, and 
what you'll use in the next example.
