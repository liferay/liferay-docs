# Assigning Template Permissions [](id=assigning-template-permissions)

Permissions for templates are similar to permissions for structures. As with
structures, you only want specific developers editing and creating templates.
You may, however, want to make the templates viewable to some content creators
who understand the template scripting language but are not directly writing the
scripts. To determine who views and interacts with the template:

1.  Go to the *Templates* tab.

2.  Click the Action* button (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-actions.png))
    for a template that you created and select *Permissions*.

You can grant or deny permissions based on Roles. For instance, you may create a
role with the ability to update the template and create a second role that can
both update and delete. @product@ makes it possible to assign permissions based 
on the roles and responsibilities within your organization.
