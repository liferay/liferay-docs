# Assigning Template Permissions [](id=assigning-template-permissions)

Permissions for templates are similar to permissions for structures. As with
structures, you only want specific developers editing and creating templates.
You may, however, want to make the templates viewable to some content creators
who understand the template scripting language but are not directly writing the
scripts. To determine who views and interacts with the template,

1.  Go to the *Templates* tab.

2.  Click the Action* button (![Actions](../../../../../images/icon-actions.png))
    for a template that you created and select *Permissions*.

You can grant or deny permissions based on Roles. For instance, you may create
a Role that can update the template and a second Role that can both update and
delete. @product@ makes it possible to assign permissions based on the roles and
responsibilities within your organization.
