# Creating Fragments [](id=creating-fragments)

To create Content Pages you first need to create Fragments. Fragments are one of
the building blocks that you can use to create rich content in Liferay.

## Creating and Managing Fragments [](id=creating-and-managing-fragments)

Start in Site Administration. You can find Fragments in the Content section.

1.  Open the main menu.

2.  Under *Site Administration* make sure the Site where you want to work is 
    selected.

3.  In the *Content* section, select *Fragments*.

The main Fragments page will display any Collections that are available for the 
current site, provide the option to Import and Export through the menu in the 
top right, and enable you to create Collections at the base level of the 
navigation. You can also manage the organization and display of Fragments and 
Collections once you have them created. Now, to create a Fragment, you must 
first create a Collection.

1.  Click the `+` button to add a Collection.

2.  Give the Collection a *Name* and *Description* and click *Save*.

Collections help you organize Fragments, and can be used to differentiate 
between different types of Fragments or Fragments used by different groups or 
departments. Next you want to create a Fragment inside of the Collection you 
created.

1.  Click on the Collection you created.

2.  Click the `+` button to create a Fragment.

3.  Give it a *Name* and click *Submit*.

Now you're looking at the Fragment creation form. Each pane in the editor has a 
different function:

*  The top left pane is for entering HTML.
*  The top right pane is for entering CSS.
*  The bottom left pane is for entering JavaScript.
*  The bottom right pane provides a live preview as you work in the other panes.

Development [link]tutorial.

After you create and publish some Fragment, you can start creating Page 
Templates to combine Fragments into pages.
