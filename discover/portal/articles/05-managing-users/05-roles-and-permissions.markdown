# Roles and Permissions [](id=roles-and-permissions)

If a *role* were to win a Grammy or an Oscar or some other ego-feeding
popularity contest, it better remember to thank all its *permissions* groupies
during the acceptance speech, because they're the ones doing the real work. The
role is just the pretty face, so to speak.

*Roles* collect *permissions* that define a particular function within
@product@, according to a particular scope. Roles collect permissions, and
users are assigned to roles, either directly or through their association with a
User Group, an Organization, or a Site. 

Take a *Message Board Administrator* role, for example. A role with that name
is likely to have permissions relevant to the specific Message Board portlets
delegated to it. Users with this role inherit the permissions collected underneath
the umbrella of the role.

Roles are managed through the Control Panel.

## Managing Roles in Liferay [](id=managing-roles-in-liferay)

Manage Liferay's roles in the Control Panel (*Control Panel* &rarr; *Users*
&rarr; *Roles*).  There you'll find an application for creating roles, granting
them permissions, and assigning users to them. Roles can be scoped by portal,
site, or organization.

![Figure 1: The Roles application lets you add and manage roles for the global (*Regular*), *Site*, or *Organization* scope.](../../images/roles-app.png)

To create a role, click the scope you want a role for and then click the *Add*
(![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)) button. Enter a name, title, and description
for the role. The name field is required but the title and description are
optional. If you enter a name and a title, the title is displayed in the list of
roles on the Roles page of the Control Panel. If you do not enter a title, the
name is displayed. When you finish, click *Save*.

**Note:** In addition to regular roles, site roles, and organization roles, there are also
teams. Teams can be created by site administrators within a specific site. The
permissions granted to a team are defined and applied only within the team's
site. The permissions defined by regular, site, and organization roles, by
contrast, are defined at the portal level, although they are applied to
different scopes. The differences between the four types of roles can be
described as follows:

- Regular role: Permissions are defined at the *portal* level and are applied at
  the *portal* level.

- Site role: Permissions are defined at the *portal* level and are applied to
  one *specific site*.

- Organization role: Permissions are defined at the *portal* level and are
  applied to one *specific organization*.

- Team: Permissions are defined within a *specific site* and are assigned within
  that *specific site*.

After you save, your role is added to the exiting list of roles. To see what
functions you can perform on your new role, click the *Actions* button.

**Edit:** lets you change the name, title or description of the role.

**Permissions:** allows you to define which users, user groups or roles have
permissions to edit the role.

**Define Permissions:** defines the permissions the role contains. 

<!-- **Assign Members:** lets you search and select users in the portal to be
assigned to this role. These users will inherit any permissions that have been
assigned to this role.

**View Users:** allows you to view the users who have been assigned to this
role.-->

**Delete:** permanently removes a role from the portal.

Once you have a role you want to configure, the first step is often to define
its permissions.

## Defining Role Permissions [](id=defining-role-permissions)

Roles collect permissions, so when a user is given a role, they receive all the
permissions defined by the role. 

![Figure 2: When defining permissions on a role, the Summary view provides a list of permissions that have already been defined for the role. The area on the left side of the screen lets you drill down through various categories of portal permissions.](../../images/roles-define-permissions.png)

To add permissions to a role, click on the *Actions*
(![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) button for a regular role and select
*Define Permissions*. Find the permissions  you want to add by navigating the
categories of permissions on the left side of the screen and click on a specific
category (such as *Site Administration* &rarr; *Navigation* &rarr; *Site
Pages*). Select any permissions that you'd like to add the role, then click
*Save*. 

+$$$

**Note:** The Roles application in the Control Panel is not the only place where
permissions are configured. You can configure a role's permissions for a particular
application instance from its *Options*
(![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) menu. However, permissions
granted or removed in the Control Panel override those made at the more granular
level.

$$$

There are three basic categories of permissions: *Control Panel*, *Site
Administration*, and *User*. By default, any Liferay user can manage their
user account via the permissions belonging to the User category. Site
Administrators can access the site administration tools belonging to the Site
Administration category. Portal Administrators can access the entire Control
Panel. For custom roles, you can mix and match permissions from as many
categories as you like.

The permissions in the Site Administration &rarr; Applications categories govern
the content that can be created by core portlets such as the Wiki and Message
Boards. If you pick one of the portlets from this list, you'll get options for
defining permissions on its content. For example, if you pick Message Boards,
you'll see permissions for creating categories and threads or deleting and
moving topics.

Site application permissions affect the application as a whole. Using the
Message Boards as an example, an application permission might define who can add
the Message Boards portlet to a page.

The Control Panel permissions affect how the Control Panel appears to the user
in the Control Panel. The Control Panel appears differently to different users,
depending on their permissions. Some Control Panel portlets have a Configuration
button and you can define who gets to see that. You can also fine-tune who gets
to see various applications in the Control Panel.

If you want to change the scope of a permission, click the *Change* link next to
the gear icon next to the permission and then choose a new scope. After you
click *Save*, you'll see a list of all permissions currently granted to the
role. From the Summary view, you can add more permissions or go back to the Role
Application default view by clicking on the *Back*
(![Back](../../images/icon-back.png)) icon.

![Figure 3: You can fine-tune which actions are defined for a role within a specific application like the Message Boards.](../../images/message-board-content-permissions.png)

Sometimes you might find that a certain permission grants more or less access
than what you expected--always test your permissions configurations! 

Suppose you need to create a role called *User Group Manager*. You'd like
to define the permissions for the User Group Manager role so that users assigned
to this role can add users to or remove users from any user group. To do this,
you can take the following steps:

1. Go to the Control Panel and then click on *Users* &rarr; *Roles*.
2. On the Regular Roles screen, click *Add* (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)).
3. After naming your role and entering a title, click *Save*.
4. Click on *Actions* (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; *Define Permissions* and drill down in the menu on the left to
   *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *User Groups*.
    -  Under the *General Permissions* heading, flag *Access in Control Panel* and
   *View*. This lets user group managers access the User Groups Control Panel
   portlet and view existing user groups.
    -  Since you'd like user group managers to be able to view user groups and
   assign members to them, you'd also check the *Assign Members* and *View*
   permissions under the *Resource Permissions* &rarr; *User Group* heading.
7. Click *Save*.

![Figure 4: Make sure to test the permissions you grant to custom roles.](../../images/user-group-manager-role.png)

Once you have created this role, you will need to assign it. To assign roles to Users, Sites, Organizations, and User Groups, click on the role, then click on the blue + button. You can choose which users and/or groups you would like to be assigned to the role. If you are assigning a group, then all users assigned to that group will inherit the role as well. 

You might expect that the role has all the permissions necessary for adding
users to user groups. After all, user group managers can view user groups,
assign members, and access User Groups in the Control Panel. However, we're
forgetting an important permission: the User Group Manager role can't view
users! This means that if they click *Assign Members* for a user group and click
on the *Available* tab, they'll see an empty list.

If you create a role with permission to access something in the Control Panel,
keep in mind that the *View Control Panel Menu* permission will be automatically
granted. Consider why this is necessary with an example.

![Figure 5: Users assigned to the User Group Manager role can't find any users to add!](../../images/no-users-found.png)

To fix this, define the missing permission on the role by drilling down to the
*Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Users and Organizations* category and
flag the *View* permission under the *Resource Permissions* &rarr; *User*
heading. Once you've saved your permissions configuration, users who've been
assigned to the User Group Manager role will be able to browse the portal's
entire list of users when assigning users to a user group.

Roles are very powerful and allow portal administrators to define various
permissions in whatever combinations they like. This gives you as much
flexibility as possible to build the site you have designed.

## Permission for Delegating Social Activities Configuration [](id=permission-for-delegating-social-activities-configuration)

There's a permission that allows site administrators to delegate responsibility
for configuring social activities to other users. To dd this permission to a
role, click *Actions* next to the desired role and select *Define Permissions*.
Find the *Site Administration* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *Social Activity*
permissions category. Flag all of the permissions and then click *Save*:

- Access in Site Administration
- Configuration
- Permissions
- Preferences
- View

Once these permissions are assigned, assignees can manage the site's Social
Activities.

## Deleting Asset Containers [](id=deleting-asset-containers)

A Web Content Folder contains Web Content articles. The Web Content Folder is
an asset container, and the Web Content Article is an asset. It's possible to
give a role permission to delete an asset container without giving the role
permission to delete individual assets. In that case, beware: if a role assignee
deletes an asset container with individual assets in it, the individual assets
themselves *will* be deleted as well.

Besides Web Content Folders, examples of asset containers include Bookmarks
Folders, Message Boards Categories, Wiki Nodes, and Documents and Media Folders.

You might not need to create a role for a certain functionality. Liferay
provides many pre-configured roles for your convenience.

## Default Liferay Roles [](id=default-liferay-roles)

In the Roles Application, you'll see a list of all the roles in Liferay, by
scope. These are some of the pre-configured roles:

- Guest: The Guest role is assigned to unauthenticated users and grants the
  lowest-level permissions within the portal.
- User: The User role is assigned to authenticated users and grants basic
  basic permissions within the portal (mostly *Add to Page* permissions for
applications).
- Power User: The Power User role grants more permissions than the User role.
  It's designed to be an extension point for distinguishing regular users from
more privileged users. For example, you can set up your portal so that only
Power Users have personal sites.
- Site Member: The Site Member role grants basic privileges within a site, such
  as the ability to visit the site's private pages.
- Site Administrator: The Site Administrator role grants the ability to manage
  *almost* all aspects of a site including site content, site memberships, and
  site settings. Site Administrators cannot delete the membership of or remove
  roles from other Site Administrators or Site Owners. They also *cannot* assign
  other users as Site Administrators or Site Owners.
- Site Owner: The Site Owner role is the same as the Site Administrator role
  except that it grants the ability to manage *all* aspects of a site, including
  the ability to delete the membership of or remove roles from Site
  Administrators or other Site Owners. They *can* assign other users as Site
  Administrators or Site Owners.
- Organization User: The Organization User role grants basic privileges within
  an organization. If the organizaIf there's one movie I could have Leone make it would be tion has an attached site, the Organization
  User role implicitly grants the Site member role within the attached site.
- Organization Administrator: The Organization Administrator role grants the
  ability to manage *almost* all aspects of an organization including the
  organization's users and the organization's site (if it exists). Organization
  Administrators cannot delete the membership of or remove roles from other
  Organization Administrators or Organization Owners. They also *cannot* assign
  other users as Organization Administrators or Organization Owners.
- Organization Owner: The Organization Owner role is the same as the
  Organization Administrator role except that it grants the ability to manage
  *all* aspects of an organization, including the ability to delete the
  membership of or remove roles from Organization Administrators or other
  Organization Owners. They *can* assign other users as Organization
  Administrators or Organization Owners.
- Administrator: The administrator role grants the ability to manage the entire
  portal, including global portal settings and individual sites, organizations,
  and users.

+$$$

**Tip:** It's easy to overlook the differences between owner type roles and
administrator type roles for sites and organizations. Site and organization
administrators *cannot* remove the administrator or owner role from any other
administrator or owner, and they *cannot* appoint other users as site or
organization administrators or owners. 

In contrast, site and organization owners *can* do those things.

$$$

Roles, and the permissions granted with their assignment, are foundational
components in Liferay. Understanding their uses and configuration should enhance
your ability to configure @product@ to suit your organizational needs.


<!--
## Note About the Power Users Role [](id=note-about-the-power-users-role)

Prior to Liferay Portal 6.0, the default configurations of many Liferay portlets
allowed power users, but not regular users, to access them. Liferay Portal 6.0 and
subsequent versions grant the same default permissions to both power users and
regular users. This way, portal administrators are not forced to use the power
users role. However, Liferay encourages those who do to create their own custom
permissions for the role. 

+$$$

**Note:** Prior to Liferay version 6.0, Power Users and Users did *not* have the
same default permissions. So if are using Liferay 5.2 or a previous version,
it's dangerous to remove the Power Users role from the default user
associations: this could remove certain permissions you expect to apply to all
users. If you decide to remove the Power Users role from the default user
associations anyway, you will probably want to modify the permissions on certain
portlets to make them accessible to all users. To do this, see the section on
Plugins Configuration below.

$$$



Now that we've seen how to use organizations and user groups to manage users and
how to use roles to define permissions, let's learn how to configure portal
password policies.
