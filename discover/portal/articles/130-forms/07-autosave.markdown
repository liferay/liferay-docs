# Auto-Save

Losing progress on a partially created form is bad. Make sure to save your work
frequently as you're creating forms. But if you forget to save your work, 
Liferay Forms has your back.

By default, a form is auto-saved every minute. You won't notice anything in the 
form builder while the backend auto-saves the form. You can change the auto-save 
duration in *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* 
&rarr; *Forms* (in the Content section). To disable auto-save, set the interval 
to *0*. 

For unpublished forms, an auto-save works just like a manual save. For a 
published form, however, auto-saved data isn't automatically propagated to the 
form. You must click the *Save* button in the form builder to publish the 
changes.
