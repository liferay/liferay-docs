# Styling Form Pages

Let's face it: nobody likes an ugly, confusing form. Styling your 
[form pages](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/form-pages) 
lets you make your forms user friendly. There are two features are available for 
styling your forms: 

1.  Create rows and columns for form fields. 
2.  Move fields from one location to another. 

Sometimes it doesn't make sense to use the default single-column, 
vertically-oriented form. For example, a form with many fields can save space by 
putting them in different columns. You can also use a mixed approach, with each 
row broken into a different number of columns. The following screenshots show 
examples of these layouts.

By default, dragging a field onto a form page adds a field that occupies an 
entire row. Follow these steps to resize the field to make room for more fields 
in the row (columns): 

1.  Hover over the field to reveal its borders:

2.  Drag the right or left edge of the field to resize it.

3.  Add a new field to the remaining space in the row.

You can also move fields. To do so, follow these steps: 

1.  Hover over the field and the cursor becomes a hand. 

2.  Drag the field to an open location in the builder. Available locations are
    highlighted in blue and outlined with a dotted line. A field moved to a new 
    row fills that entire row. A field moved to an existing row fills that row's 
    remaining space.
