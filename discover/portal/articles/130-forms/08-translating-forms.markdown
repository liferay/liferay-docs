# Translating Forms

Forms are translatable, into any locale supported by @product@. The form
builder specifies a translation of the Default Language for the form.

The default language of the form and the available translations are set in the
[site's language configuration in Site Settings](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/social-settings-and-languages#languages).

To create a translation of a form,

1.  Go to the Site Menu &rarr; Content &rarr; Forms and open the form to
    translate.

2.  Click *Add Translation* and choose from the available languages.

3.  Translate the form's title, field labels, field options, field placeholder
    text, and any other text that appears to the User.

4.  Save and Publish the form.

To fill out a translated form in a translated language,

1.  Access the form.

    If a signed in User accesses the form, and a translation is available in the
    User's language, the User sees the translated form by default. 

2.  To see the form in a different language, click the language icon and select
    an alternative language.

3.  Fill out the form as usual and click *Submit*.
