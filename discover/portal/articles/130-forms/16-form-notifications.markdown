# Form Notifications

You can configure the Forms app to send a notification email each time a form 
entry is submitted.

1.  Open the form's *Form Settings* section by clicking the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../images/icon-options.png)) 
    and selecting *Settings*. 

2.  Click the *Email Notifications* tab, enable the option 
    *Send an email notification for each entry*, and fill out these fields: 

    -   **From Name:** The sender's name. This could be the site name, the form 
        name, or anything else informative to the recipient.
    -   **From Address:** The sender's email address. You can use something like 
        `noreply@liferay-forms.com`, so that recipients don't try to reply. 
    -   **To Address:** The recipient's email address (e.g., 
        `test@liferay.com`). 
    -   **Subject:** The email's subject. An informative subject line tells the 
        recipient what happened. For example, 
       *An application for employment was submitted in The Lunar Resort*. 

Note that if you 
[enabled workflow for the form](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-and-forms) 
and it already sends a notification, you might not need to configure the Forms 
app to generate a notification.
