# Using Templates to Display Forms and Lists [](id=using-templates-to-display-forms-and-lists)

After creating data definitions and lists, you can control how the form appears
to your users, and how the resulting list of records is displayed. You do this
by creating templates for each view (form view and record display view) and
selecting them in the DDL Display portlet. For example, you might need to create 
a form with a subset of a data definition's fields. Rather than creating a new 
definition, you can create a template that displays only the fields you want 
from the existing definition. You could also use a template to arrange fields 
differently, and/or with different labels and configuration options. 

Data definitions can have as many form and display templates as you care to
create (or none, if you're satisfied with the default templates). You then 
choose a list's template in the Dynamic Data Lists Display widget. 

## Managing Display and Form Templates [](id=managing-display-and-form-templates)

Since Display and Form Templates correspond to a particular data definition, 
they're accessed from the Data Definitions screen of the Dynamic Data Lists app 
in Site Administration. See the 
[Creating Data Definitions article](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-data-definitions) 
for instructions on accessing this screen. 

The Data Definitions screen lists each definition in a table. To start working 
with a definition's templates, click the definition's Actions button 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
and select *Manage Templates*. This opens a screen that lists the definition's 
templates. You can edit, copy, delete, or configure permissions for a 
definition via its Actions button 
(![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)).
