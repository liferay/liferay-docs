# Integrating with Facebook [](id=integrating-with-facebook)

Facebook is currently the number one social network in the world with somewhere
over 1 billion active users. If you're trying to build a community on your 
site, you don't want to neglect a bridge to that many possible users. With 
that in mind, Liferay provides a few easy ways for you to integrate your site 
with Facebook.

## Facebook Sign On [](id=facebook-sign-on)

Like many websites you may visit, any site running on Liferay can be set up
to use Facebook for sign in. This makes it easier for users to sign in to your
site, since they won't need to remember another user name and password. See the
[article](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/facebook-connect-single-sign-on-authentication) in the Discover/Deployment section for information on using Facebook to
sign into Liferay. 

## Using Your Application as Facebook Applications [](id=using-your-portlets-as-facebook-applications)

You can add any Liferay portlet as an application on Facebook. To do this, you
must first get a developer key. A link for doing this is provided to you in the
Facebook tab in any application's Configuration screen. You will have to create the
application on Facebook and get the key and canvas page URL from Facebook. Once
you've done this, you can copy and paste their values into the Facebook tab.
Once you do that, your application is available on Facebook.

This integration enables you to make things like Message Boards, Calendars,
Wikis, and other content on your website available to a much larger audience
(unless you already have a billion users on your site, in which case, kudos to
you). If you're a developer, you could implement your game or other application
on Liferay and then publish it to Facebook.
