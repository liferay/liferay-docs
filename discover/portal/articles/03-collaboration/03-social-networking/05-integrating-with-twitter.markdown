# Integrating with Twitter [](id=integrating-with-twitter)

Liferay also provides integration with Twitter via the Twitter app on [Liferay
Marketplace](http://liferay.com/marketplace). Once you register your 
Twitter username with the app, your tweets are shown in your Activities
application along with your activity feed. Make sure that you get the
appropriate version of the app for your Liferay instance. 

There are two ways to register your Twitter username with the app after you 
install it. The first is through the Twitter portlet after you add it to a page. 
Click the link in the portlet and then enter your Twitter username in the 
Twitter field.

It's important to note that your tweets are displayed *only* in an Activities 
application. If you want your tweets to show up on a page, there must be an 
Activities application on it. Also, you need to wait a few minutes after registering 
your Twitter username for your tweets to show up. Keep in mind that your tweets
are shown in order according to the date and time that you originally made them.
Therefore, if you haven't tweeted in a while, then your tweets might be pushed
off the Activities feed by more recent activity. You can change the number of
items shown in the Activities feed in its Configuration.
