# Creating Pages with Layouts [](id=creating-pages-with-layouts)

<div class="learn-path-step">
    <p>Creating A Site<br>Step 1 of 6</p>
</div>

Up to this point everything on the Welcome page stretches the width of the
entire page. You can control this with *page layouts*. For example, the Welcome
page has the simplest possible layout: one column. Any items in that column take
up its full width. You can place anything above or below but not to the side
of any existing item on the page. @product@ contains other layouts that arrange
items into different numbers of columns and rows. This gives you a great deal of
control over how applications and content appear in your site. 

<!-- Russ QA: Because I created my own site for The Lunar Resort, the layout by
default was 2 column 30-70 not 1 column. Depending on how that initial step is supposed to work, this might need to change. --> 

You'll next use layouts to create the Activities and About Us pages for the
Lunar Resort.

## Creating the Activities Page [](id=creating-the-activities-page)

As you may be able to tell from the above screenshot, the Activities page uses
a two column layout with a small column on the left and a large column on the
right. Follow these steps to create this page:

1.  Open the main menu and expand the *Navigation* menu for *The Lunar Resort*. 

2.  In the Navigation menu, click the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) for *Public Pages* and select 
    *Add Public Page*.

    You are now on the page creation form. You can set the page name, choose a 
    template or layout, and set several other options.

3.  Enter *Activities* for the *Name*.

4.  For the layout, select *2 Columns (30/70)*. This sets the page to the two
    column layout. The smaller left column takes up 30% of the page, and the
    larger right column takes up 70% of the page.

5.  Leave the other options on their default settings and click *Add Page*. 

The Lunar Resort site now contains the Activities page. This page appears in the 
navigation, and you can add applications and content to it just as you would any 
other page. 

## Creating the About Us Page [](id=creating-the-about-us-page)

Now you'll create the *About Us* page. Note in the above screenshot that this
page has three columns. Follow these steps to create this page:

1.  In the main menu, expand the *Navigation* menu for *The Lunar Resort*. 

2.  In the Navigation menu, click the *Options* button 
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) for *Public Pages* and select 
    *Add Public Page*. 

3.  Enter *About Us* for the Name. 

4.  For the layout, select *3 Columns*. 

5.  Leave the other options on their default settings and click *Add Page*. 

The navigation bar now contains the two new pages that you just created. Next,
you'll create a couple more pages and then arrange their order in the
navigation bar.

<!-- 
Replace with a screenshot that shows more of the page. In the current screenshot 
it's impossible to tell where the nav bar is located on the page.
