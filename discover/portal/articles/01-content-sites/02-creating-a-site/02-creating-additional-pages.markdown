The Lunar Resort needs two more pages: 

-   Lunar Guides: A page that lists the guides employed by the Lunar Resort.
-   Book a Trip: A page for booking a trip to the Lunar Resort.

You'll create these pages using the same steps you used to create the existing 
pages. 
<!-- 
Double-check the page layouts for these pages to make sure they're as intended, 
and not just copied over from the earlier instructions.
