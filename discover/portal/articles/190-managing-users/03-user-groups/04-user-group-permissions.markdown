# Configuring User Group Permissions

Administrators commonly create user groups to allow the group's users to take 
some specific action in a site. This is done by assigning the permissions for 
that action to a role, and then assigning that role to the user group. This 
grants the role's permissions to the user group's users. 

Follow these steps to grant permissions to users in a user group: 

1.  [Create the user group](liferay.com).
2.  [Assign the user group to a site](liferay.com). 
3.  [Create the site role and define its permissions](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions). 
4.  Assign the role to the user group. 

For instructions on the first 3 steps, click those links above. This article 
shows you how to assign a role to a user group. Follow these steps to do so: 

1.  Open the Menu 
    (![Menu](../../../images/icon-menu.png)), 
    select the site you want to work in, then open its Site Administration menu. 

2.  In the Site Administration menu, select *Members* &rarr; *Site Memberships*. 
    This opens the Site Memberships screen.

    user groups currently assigned to the site. 

4.  Click the *Actions* button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    for the user group you want to assign to a role, and select 
    *Assign Site Roles*. This opens the Assign Site Roles dialog.
