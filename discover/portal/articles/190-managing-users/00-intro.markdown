# Managing Users [](id=managing-users)

Ever heard a retailer advertise as a "one stop shop" for anything you want? The
idea is they have so much stuff that whatever you want is probably there.
Liferay's Control Panel is like this. Where do you create users, organizations,
or sites? Where do you configure permissions and plugins and pretty much
anything else? You do it from the Control Panel. When signed in as an
administrator, you can access the Control Panel from the Product Menu by
clicking *Control Panel*.

The Control Panel is divided into four main areas: Users, Sites, Apps,
and Configuration. The Users section lets you create and manage users,
organizations, user groups, roles, and password policies. If monitoring has been
enabled for your portal, you can also view all the live portal sessions of your
users. If the Audit plugins have been installed from Liferay Marketplace, the
Audit section also appears.

## What's New with User Management? [](id=whats-new-with-user-management)

In @product@ version 7.0, the user management functionality and behavior didn't
change much from previous versions. Improvements to existing behavior were
introduced, but most of the work went into the back-end code so that future
enhancements could be made. In @product-ver@, we're excited to announce some new
features for user administrators:

1.  Numeric screen names can be used without issue out of the box. Read
    [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-management-additional-topics#numeric-screen-names) 
    for the details.

2.  Add organization types from System Settings. There's no need for portal
    properties anymore, or the requisite system restart. Read
    [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-organizations#organization-types) 
    for the details.

3.  Configure default user profile pictures from System Settings. Read
    [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/user-management-additional-topics#user-profile-pictures) 
    for the details.

adding and editing users.
