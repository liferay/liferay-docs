# Site Facet [](id=site-facet)

The Site Facet narrows search results down to those existing in a certain site.
Each Site with content matching the searched keyword appears as a facet term.

![Figure 1: Each Site with matching content is a facet term.](../../../images/search-site-facet.png)

For the Site Facet to display multiple sites, the Search Bar must be configured
to search *Everything*. See more about search scope
[here](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/searching-for-assets#configuring-the-search-bar).
If not searching for Everything, only the current site is searched, and the Site
Facet has nothing to display. When this occurs, the Site Facet is hidden on the
page.

**Note:** Configuring the globally embedded page-top Search Bar to search for
Everything not only configures the embedded Search Bar on all pages. It also
ensures that the Search Page's Search Bar searches Everything, because the
page-top Search Bar's configuration overrides the Search Page's Search Bar
configuration. The same does not apply to other Search Bar widgets in the site.
Each of these must be configured as desired.

If the global Search Bar is disabled, configure the Search Page's Search Bar
widget to search for Everything.

To configure the search scope,

1.  Open the Search Bar's Options menu
    (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png))
    and click *Configuration*.

2.  Set the Scope option to *Everything*.

3.  Click *Save* and close the pop-up.

The Site Facet contains several configuration options:

**Site Parameter Name**
: Set the URL parameter name for the Facet. The default is *site*. Searching for
*lunar resort* and clicking on a site facet produces the URL

        http://localhost:8080/web/guest/search?q=lunar resort&site=20126

**Max Terms**
: Set the maximum number of facet terms to display, regardless of how many
matching terms are found for the facet.

**Frequency Threshold**
: Set the minimum frequency required for terms to appear in the list of facet
terms. For example, if the frequency threshold of a facet is set to `3`, a term
with two matching results doesn't appear in the term result list.

**Display Frequencies**
: Choose whether or not to display the term frequencies.
