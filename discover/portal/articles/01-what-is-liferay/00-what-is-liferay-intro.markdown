since you might be in a rush, we'll give you all the reasons in a nutshell
right here, and then you can read the details in the rest of the chapter. 

The reasons to use Liferay Portal for your website are simple: it provides a
robust *platform* to serve your site to all clients, be they desktop, mobile, or
anything in between; it provides all the standard *applications* you need to run

applications or customization. In addition to this, Liferay Portal is developed
using an open source methodology, by people from around the world. The code base
is solid, and has been proved to be reliable and stable in mission critical
deployments in diverse industries.
