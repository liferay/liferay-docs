# Reviewing Assets [](id=reviewing-assets)

User interaction is required at each workflow process Task Node. How do
users complete tasks? In the *My Workflow Tasks* application of the *My Account*
menu.

## Asset Submission to Workflow [](id=asset-submission-to-workflow)

If an Asset has a workflow activated, when a user clicks Submit for Publication,
the workflow definition determines the next step. A user assigned a Role
associated to the workflow task receives a Notification indicating that there is
a workflow task to complete.

## Assigning the Task [](id=assigning-the-task)

Workflow Tasks can be completed only by certain users, based on the 
[Assignment](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-task-nodes#assignments).

All workflow tasks assigned directly to a user are listed in the My Workflow
Task widget's *Assigned to Me* tab.

![Figure 2: The assets assigned to a user are listed in *Assigned to Me*.](../../images/workflow-assigned-to-me.png)

If a workflow was assigned to a Role that the user occupies, the workflow's
tasks appear in the *Assigned to My Roles* tab.

![Figure 3: The Assets assigned to Roles are listed in each associated user's *Assigned to My Roles* tab.](../../images/workflow-assigned-to-my-roles.png)

To claim a task, the user must move the task into the *Assigned to Me* tab.

1.  Click the Asset's *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Assign to Me*.

2.  Add a comment in the pop-up box if necessary, and click *Done*.

Alternatively, assign the task to another user.

1.  Click the Asset's *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Assign to ...*.

2.  Select the user to assign the task.

3.  Add a comment in the pop-up box if necessary, and click *Done*.

## Completing the Task [](id=completing-the-task)

Once a task is assigned, it's ready to be completed.

There's a fast way to send an asset along in the review process:

1.  From the *Assigned to Me* tab, click the *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) and select *Approve* or
    *Reject*.

    Note that options names in this menu are identical to the the workflow 
    definition's
    [Transition](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/workflow-definition-nodes)
    names. Your menu might have different options than the *Approve* and
    *Reject* options in the figure below.

2.  Enter a comment if desired and click *Done*.

![Figure 4: Complete Tasks right from the *Assigned to Me* list.](../../images/workflow-complete-task.png)

Here's how to get a closer look at the Asset before sending it along in the
workflow:

1.  From the *Assigned to Me* tab, click the title of the Asset to review.

    The Task screen appears showing details about the Asset:

    ![Figure 5: Inspect Assets before completing the Task.](../../images/workflow-task-review.png)

2.  Inspect the Asset to your liking (or even edit it if you have permission)
    and click the *Actions* button
    (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)).

3.  Send it along in the workflow by clicking one of the Transition names (for
    example, *Approve* or *Reject* in the Single Approver Definition).

And, you're done. Once you've completed your workflow tasks, kick back and wait
for more to come in.
