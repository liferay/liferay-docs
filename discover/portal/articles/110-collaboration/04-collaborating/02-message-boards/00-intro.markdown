# Creating Forums with Message Boards

@product@'s Message Boards app is a state of the art forum app similar to many 
forums you may have participated in. This app, however, leverages the rest of 
the Liferay platform to provide an integrated experience that others can't 
match. 

In many web sites, it's obvious that there's no link between the main site and 
the message boards. In some cases, users are even required to register twice: 
once for the main site and once for the message boards. Sometimes it's even 
three times: once for the site, once for the message boards, and once for the 
shopping cart. By providing a message boards app along with all of the other 
apps, @product@ provides a unique, integrated approach to building sites. You 
can concentrate on building your site while the integration work is done for 
you.
