# Message Board Permissions [](id=message-board-permissions)

To edit message board permissions, first open the Message Boards app in your 
scope's Site Administration menu, as described in 
[the article on creating message boards](https://www.liferay.com/). 
Then click the *Options* icon 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-options.png)) and select the 
*Home Category Permissions* option. This permissions screen lets you grant and 
revoke a role's ability to access parts of the app and perform particular 
actions. 

The permissions enable a role to perform the following actions: 

-   **Lock Thread:** Stop any further additions or modifications to a thread's
    messages. 

-   **Subscribe:** Enlist yourself to receive notifications on new and modified
    posts. 

-   **Reply to Message:** Respond to an existing message. 

-   **Add File:** The user can attach a file to his message. 

-   **Permissions:** View and modify permissions. 

-   **Add Message:** Post a new thread. 

-   **View:** View all the contents of message threads. 

-   **Add Category:** Add a new category to the message board. 

-   **Update Thread Priority:** Modify a thread's priority. 

-   **Ban User:** Forbid a user from participating in the message board. 

-   **Move Thread:** Move a thread to a different category or subcategory. 

Configure the roles with the permissions you want and *Save* your changes. 

After adding a Message Boards widget to a page, you can access that widget 
instance's general permissions. To do so, select the widget's *Options* menu 
(![Options](../../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) and select *Permissions*. 
This permissions screen lets you control access to the widget instance's 
Permissions, Preferences, and Configuration menus.
