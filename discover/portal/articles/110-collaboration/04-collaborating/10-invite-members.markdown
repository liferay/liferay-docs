# Inviting Members to Your Site [](id=inviting-members-to-your-site)

The Invite Members widget lets site administrators send invitations to join the 
site. You can add this widget to a page from the 
menu *Add* 
(![Add](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) 
&rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Collaboration*. Click the button 
*Invite members to this site* to bring up the interface for sending invitations.

Click the plus sign next to a user or click the *Add Email Address* button to 
add a user to the invite list. Users that have already been invited but have not 
yet responded are listed with a check mark next to their names. You can also
invite users to the *Site Owner*, *Site Content Reviewer*, and 
*Site Administrator* roles for your site by selecting that role under the 
*Invite to Role* heading. Once you've added all the users you want to invite and 
have selected the role they should have, click the *Send Invitations* button to 
invite them. For more information on roles, see the 
[Roles and Permissions documentation](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/roles-and-permissions). 

The site invitation shows up under the *Requests List* tab on the user's 
*Notifications* page. The user can then choose to *Confirm* or *Ignore* the 
invitation.

When users confirm such invitations, they become site members assigned to the 
roles you defined.
