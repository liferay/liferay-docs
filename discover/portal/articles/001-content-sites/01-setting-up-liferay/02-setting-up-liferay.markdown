# Setting up @product@

The Basic Configuration page lets you set the following for your portal:

- Portal name
- Portal administrator
- Default language
- Whether to autogenerate sample data for demo purposes
- Database configuration

Follow these steps to configure your portal for the Lunar Resort:

1.  Enter *The Lunar Resort* for the *Portal Name*. 

2.  If you prefer to work in a language other than the system default, change 
    the *Default Language* to your preferred language. 

3.  Enter your name and email address for the *Administrator User*. You'll use 
    this email address to sign in to the @product@ instance as the 
    administrator. Note that for testing purposes, this doesn't have to be a 
    real email address. 
    
4.  Uncheck *Add Sample Data*. 

5.  Leave the default database (Hypersonic) selected, and click *Finish 
    Configuration*. Note that the default database is fine for testing and 
    development, but should **never** be used in production.

6.  At the bottom of the next page, click *I Agree* to accept the terms of use 
    and continue. 

7. Create a password for the administrative user, and then click *Save*.

8. Finally, choose a security question and answer to complete the setup.

Note: At this stage for Liferay DXP you will need to deploy an activation key 
or activate through LCS. You can obtain a trial key from Liferay's 
[Enterprise Trial page](https://web.liferay.com/c/portal/register_trial_license?redirect=/digital-experience-platform/30-day-trial).

@product@ now presents the *Welcome* page. If you see the screen below, you have 
successfully set up your @product@ server. Next, you'll learn some @product@ 
basics.
