# Identification and Social

The Identification and Social sections of Instance Settings are smaller thatn
some of the other sections, but contain important Instance Settings for some
virtual isntances.

## Identification [](id=identification)

The Identification section has several links for addresses, phone numbers and
other contact information for the organization that owns the instance.
Developers can query for this information in their applications.

## Social [](id=social)

The Social section configures Ratings and Mentions throughout the instance. For
each of Liferay's core portlets that has ratings enabled, choose whether to use
a simple *Like*, *Thumbs*, or *Stars* for rating the content. You can also
choose whether Users can mention (*@Username*) other Users, and if so, whether
all Users have the capability or whether you want to further refine the mentions
configuration.
