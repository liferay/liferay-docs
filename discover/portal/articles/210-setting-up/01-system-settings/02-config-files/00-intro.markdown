# Understanding System Configuration Files [](id=understanding-system-configuration-files)

@product@'s 
[System Settings app](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/system-settings) 
is convenient for making system-scoped configuration changes and setting default
configurations for other
[scopes](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-liferay#configuration-scope).
But there's another supported configuration approach: configuration files. You
can use configuration files to transfer configurations from pre-production
systems to production systems, or between any other @product@ systems. Sometimes
developers choose to distribute the default configuration for their applications
via configuration file. Whatever the reason, configuration files are a 
straightforward way of configuring @product@.
