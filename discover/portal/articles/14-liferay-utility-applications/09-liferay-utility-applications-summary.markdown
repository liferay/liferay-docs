In this chapter, we examined several Liferay utility applications: the Bookmarks
portlet, the Shopping portlet, the Software Catalog, the Reports and
JasperReports applications, the Knowledge Base, the Akismet application, the
Weather portlet, and the OAuth application.

The Bookmarks portlet allows users and administrators to collect and share
useful link to pages either within or outside of the portal. The Shopping
portlet allows you to use PayPal to set up your portal for E-commerce activity.
The Software Catalog allows you to define a set of software items to make
available to visitors to your portal. Remember that the Software Catalog has
been replaced by Liferay Marketplace. If you want to use it, you'll have to
manually install it as a plugin. The Reports application is an EE-only
application that provides a Reports Admin portlet in the Control Panel for
creating reports and scheduling report generation. When combined with a suitable
implementation, such as the JasperReports application (also EE-only), you can
upload report definitions in the Reports Admin portlet, generate reports, and
export reports to a wide variety of formats.

The Knowledge Base application is an EE-only application that allows you to
create articles and organize them into full books or guides that be published on
your portal. The Akismet application offers a web-based spam detection service
for your portal's message boards, blogs, wikis, and comments. The Weather
portlet provides users with a summary of weather-related information for
multiple locations and provides a links to [Open Weather
Map](http://openweathermap.org/) for more detailed information for each
location. Lastly, the EE-only OAuth application manages third-party
applications' access to your portal's resources and vice versa. Next, let's take
a tour of the Liferay Marketplace and learn how to manage Liferay plugins.
