# Weather [](id=weather)

Liferay's Weather portlet displays basic weather-related information
(temperature, conditions) for multiple configurable locations. It's available as
an app from Liferay Marketplace. For each configured location, a link to [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/)
is provided that points to more detailed information. The Weather portlet also
provides a search bar that allows users to find information about locations that
aren't listed by the portlet. Searching via the search bar forwards the user to
[Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/), where the search is executed.

To configure the displayed locations, open the Weather portlet's configuration
window. In the first text area, enter the names of the cities about which you'd
like weather information to be displayed. Alternatively, you can use zip codes.
Enter one city or zip code per line. For the temperature format, you can choose
between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
