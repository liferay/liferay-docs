# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus [](id=creating-and-managing-site-navigation-menus)

With @product_ver@ you can create and rearrange pages, content, and applications
using customizable Navigation Menus. Not only can you heavily customize a single
menu and page hierarchy, you can also create any number of menus with different
organizations and hierarchies to present your content to customers any way you
choose.

The default menu functions just like it always has: when you add a page, it is
added to the menu. You can create subpages and build the page hierarchy out any
way you like. Go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* to view the existing pages
or create new pages.

The site hierarchy as displayed on the *Pages* page is the main reference for 
the organization of pages on that site. While Navigation menus can customize
what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu is always the "true" reference
for the pages on your site.
