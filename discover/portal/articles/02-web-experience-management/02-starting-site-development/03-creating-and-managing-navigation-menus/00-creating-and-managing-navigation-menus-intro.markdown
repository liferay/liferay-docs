# Creating and Managing Site Navigation Menus

With @product_ver@ you can create and rearrange pages, content, and 
applications with customizable Navigation Menus. Not only can you heavily 
customize a single menu and page hierarchy, you can also create any number of 
menus with different organizations and hierarchies to present your content to
customers any way you choose.

The default menu in Liferay functions just like it always has - when you add a 
page it is added to the menu. You can create subpages and build the page 
hierarchy out any way you like. Go to *Navigation* &rarr; *Site Pages* to view
the existing pages or create new pages.

The site hierarchy as displayed on the *Pages* page is the main reference for 
the organization of pages on that site. While Navigation menus can customize 
what appears and what doesn't appear, this menu will always be the "true" 
reference for the pages on your site.
