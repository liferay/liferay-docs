## Adding Applications to a Page [](id=adding-applications-to-a-page)

Layout pages are composed of applications. To add an app to a page, just click
the *Add* button (![Add](../../../images/icon-control-menu-add.png)) from the 
top menu and select the *Applications* tab. You can either browse through the 
categories of available apps until you find the one you're looking for or you 
can search for apps by name. Once you've found an app, click the *Add* button 
to add it to the current page. Once it's been added to the page, you can drag 
it to a new position. Alternatively, you can drag the app directly from the 
Applications menu to a specific location on the page. Follow the steps below to 
add some Collaboration apps to the Lunar Resort site.

1. From the top menu, select *Add* &rarr; *Applications*.
2. In the menu that appears, expand the *Collaboration* category.
3. Drag the *Blogs Aggregator* app from the Add Application window to the right
   column of your page.
4. Next, drag the *Wiki* app to the left column.

See how easy it is to add applications to your pages? You've added the Wiki
app and Blogs Aggregator app to a page.

It's easy to make your pages look exactly the way you want them to. If the
default layout options provided aren't enough, you can even develop your own.
For more information about developing custom layout templates, see the tutorial 
[Layout Templates with the Liferay Theme Generator](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-layout-templates-with-the-themes-generator-0). 

Next, you'll practice personalizing pages using page customizations!

## Personalizing Pages [](id=personalizing-pages)

Administrators can designate pages or sections of pages to be customizable. When
a user visits such a page, a notification appears stating that the user can
customize the page. Users can make customizations only in the sections of pages
designated by administrators. Customizations are based on the rows and columns
of a page layout. Page customizations are only visible to the user who made the
customizations. By default, site members can make page customizations but
non-site members and guests can't.

To enable page customizations as an administrator, first click *Configure Page*
from the *Options* button next to the Page you'd like to let site members
modify. Then select the *Advanced* tab at the top of the page, expand the
*Customization Settings* area, and click on the *Customizable* selector button. 

![Figure 8: To enable page customizations, click on the *Configure Page* button next to the page, expand the *Customization Settings* area, and click on the *Customizable* button.](../../../images/page-customizations.png)

Once you've enabled the *Customizable* selector, you can select the sections of
the page you'd like to enable customization for, depending on the layout
template of your page. Enable one or more of the *Customizable* sections to
allow site members to customize certain sections of the page. Regions that
you've designated as customizable are colored blue.

When site members visit your customizable page, they'll see an extended Control
Menu with a notification saying *You can customize this page*. Site members can
toggle whether to view or hide the customizable regions. If you toggle the
selector to view customizable regions, the regions on the page are color-coded
to help distinguish customizable vs. non-customizable sections of the page.

![Figure 9: Customizable regions are colored green and non-customizable regions are colored red.](../../../images/color-coded-customizable-regions.png)

Site members can also choose between viewing their customized page and viewing
the default page by selecting the *Options* button
(![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) from the Control Menu and
clicking the *View Page without my customizations* or *View My Customized Page*.

There's also a *Reset My Customizations* option available from the *Options*
button that restores a user's customized page to match the default page. This
allows users to discard one set of customizations and start a new set without
having to manually undo each customization that they'd previously made.

Note that non-administrator site members can access the Add menu from the top
right side of the screen when viewing their customizable page even if they don't
ordinarily have permission to view this menu. This allows them to add apps to
the sections of the page that they're allowed to customize. If they click *View
Page without my customizations*, the Add menu will disappear from the menu since
they're not allowed to modify the default page.

Administrators of customizable pages have the same two views as site members:
the *default page* view and the *customized page* view. Changes made to the
default page affect all users, whereas changes made to the customized page
affect only the administrator who made the changes. Changes made by
administrators to non-customizable sections in the default view are immediately
applied for all users. Changes made by administrators to customizable sections,
however, do *not* overwrite users' customizations.

Users can make two kinds of customizations to customizable regions. First, they
can configure applications within the customizable regions. Second, they can add
apps to or remove apps from the customizable regions.

![Figure 10: Customizable areas are highlighted green when organizing apps on the page.](../../../images/customizable-regions.png)

@product@ doesn't allow users to change a non-instanceable app's configuration
inside a customizable region since those kinds of apps are tied to the site to
which they've been added. If this were allowed, the customization would affect
all users, not just the one who customized the region. Therefore, changes to the
app configuration in a customizable region are only possible for instanceable
apps, whose app configuration only affects that one user.

For example, suppose that you, as an administrator, selected the right column of
the Welcome page of the Lunar Resort site to be customizable. A member of the
Lunar Resort site could take the following steps to make a personal
customization of the Welcome page:

1. Navigate to the Welcome homepage by clicking the Site Administration's
   *Site Selector* button (![Compass](../../../images/icon-compass.png)) and
   selecting the Lunar Resort site.
2. Add the Language Selector app to the right column of the page by clicking the
   *Add* icon, clicking on *Applications*, searching for *Language Selector*,
   and clicking *Add* next to its name.

The Language Selector application is useful to have on your homepage if you
expect users who speak different languages to access your instance. Users can
select their language in the Language Selector app to view a translation of your
site into their native language. After closing the Configuration dialog box of
the Language Selector app, the customized Welcome page looks like this:

![Figure 11: In this example, the user added the Language app, and changed the display style from icons to a select box.](../../../images/customized-portal-homepage.png)

To allow users to customize a page, administrators must grant users permission
to *Customize* pages under the Site section. This can be achieved by assigning
permission to a role, then assigning this role to the appropriate users. For
example, if you want any logged user to be able to customize your customizable
pages, you could assign the *Customize* permission to the role *User*. If you
want site members to be able to customize the customizable pages of their sites,
you would accept the default setting. By default, the *Customize* permission is
assigned to the role *Site Member*.

In addition to granting the ability to customize app configurations, the
*Customize* permission allows users to customize the look and feel of apps
and to import or export app settings. Next, you'll look at how to change page
permissions.

## Changing Page Permissions [](id=changing-page-permissions)

By default, public pages are just that: public. They can be viewed by anybody,
logged in or not logged in. And private pages are really only private from
non-members of the site. If someone has joined your site or is a member of your
organization, that person can see all the private pages. You can, however,
modify the permissions on individual pages in either page group so only certain
users can view them.

Suppose you want to create a page only for administrators to see. You can do
this with the following procedure:

1. Go to your site's Site Administration dropdown and select *Navigation* &rarr;
   *Private Pages*. If you don't have the *Private Pages* option available,
   select the *Options* button next to Public Pages and click *Add Private
   Page*. Remember, these pages by default are viewable only by members of the
   site.
2. Create a page called *Admin Tips*.
3. Click *Configure Page* from the Options button dropdown for the page in the
   left menu.
4. Select *Permissions* from the *Options* icon
   (![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png)) in the top right corner of the
   screen.
4. Uncheck the *View* and *Add Discussion* permissions next to the Site Member
   role.
5. Click the *Save* button.

![Figure 12: The Permissions offer a plethora of options for each role.](../../../images/web-content-page-permissions.png)

Congratulations! You've changed the permissions for this page so only site
administrators can view it. Any users you add to this role can now see the page.
Other users, even members of this site, won't have permission to see it.

Pages in @product@ are as flexible as pages you'd create manually without a
Liferay instance. Using a point and click interface, you can define your site
any way you want. You can create and remove pages, export and import them, set
their layouts, define how they are indexed by search engines, and more.

You now understand how to manage pages in @product@. It's time to move on
to further customizing those pages for mobile devices and building standardized
pages using custom templates.
