# Creating and Managing Pages [](id=creating-and-managing-pages)

You've successfully created a site for your Liferay instance, but you may need
to add new pages or edit existing pages. From the Site Administration &rarr;
*Navigation* section of the Menu, your site pages can be accessed and
configured. If you're not currently on the site you'd like to edit, click the
*Site Selector* button (![Compass](../../../../images/icon-compass.png)) next to 
your current site name in the Menu and select your desired site. The edits you 
make to your pages are only made to the scope you've selected in the Menu.

![Figure 1: The Sites Pages page allows you to edit your site pages as a whole.](../../../../images/managing-site-pages.png)

Open the Navigation tab and click on *Site Pages* to manage pages. From here, 
you'll manage your public and private page sets as well as page templates. 
Page sets are always associated with sites. Even users' personal pages are part 
of their personal sites. All pages belong to one of two types of page sets: 
public pages and private pages. By default, public pages are accessible to 
anyone, even non-logged in users (guests). Private pages are accessible only to 
users who are members of the site which owns the pages. This means the private 
pages of an organization's site would only be viewable by site members and 
members of the organization. 

Regardless of whether the pages are public or private, @product@ uses the same
interface to manage them. You'll look at this interface more closely next.
