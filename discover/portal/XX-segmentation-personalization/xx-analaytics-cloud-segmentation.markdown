# Using Analytics Cloud With User Segments

Analytics Cloud is a Liferay service that provides in depth information on who
is using your site, and how they are using. It can also be integrated with 
Segmentation to expand your ability to personalize content for your users. For 
more information about Analytics Cloud, including instructions for connecting
you server to it, read the [Analytics Cloud Documentation](link).

Once you're connected to Analytics Cloud, follow these steps to see how it can
improve your experience for using Segmentation to create Personalized 
experiences.

## Creating a new Segment

Once you have connected Analytics Cloud and Liferay DXP, you can create 
Segments in Analytics Cloud to capture data in DXP. From Analytics Cloud,

1.  Go to *Segments* and click *Create Segment.

2.  Enter the segment name.

3.  Select a *Segment Type*.

    Dynamic Segments are defined based on the specified
    criteria, and will include any users that meet that criteria, while Static 
    segments are manually selected, and do not update dynamically.
    
4.  Set the Segment Criteria just like you would in the Site Segments creator.

This Segment will also appear in the list of Segments for all of your Sites on 
your server as well.

## Getting Segment Analytics

After you have created a Segment, you can check the data for those users in Analytics Cloud:

1.  Go to the *Segments* page

2.  Click on the name of your Segment.

From here you can view a customizable collection of analytics data for the 
users in your segments. For more information on these features, see the 
official [Analytics Cloud documentation](link).
