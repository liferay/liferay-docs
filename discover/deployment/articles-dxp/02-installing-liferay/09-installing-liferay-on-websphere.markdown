# Installing @product@ on WebSphere 8.5.5 [](id=installing-liferay-dxp-on-websphere-8-5-5)

IBM &reg; WebSphere &reg; is a trademark of International Business Machines 
Corporation, registered in many jurisdictions worldwide. 

+$$$

**Tip:** Throughout this installation and configuration process, WebSphere 
prompts you to click *Save* to apply changes to the Master Configuration. Do so 
intermittently to save your changes. 

$$$

For @product@ to work correctly, WebSphere 8.5.5 Fix Pack 11 (or later) must be 
installed.  You can find more information about this fix pack 
[here](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24043005). 

Please also note that @product@ doesn't support the WebSphere Application 
Liberty Profile. 

You should also read the following articles to familiarize yourself with 
@product@'s general installation steps: 

- [Preparing for Install](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/preparing-for-install)
- [Installing @product@](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-liferay-dxp)
- [Installing @product@ Manually](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-liferay-manually)

Note that the 
[*Liferay Home* folder](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-liferay-portal#liferay-home)
is important to the operation of @product@. In Liferay Home, @product@ creates 
certain files and folders that it needs to run. On WebSphere, Liferay Home is 
typically `[Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/your-profile/liferay`. 

And lastly, download @product@'s WAR file and dependencies from the customer 
portal on 
[liferay.com](https://web.liferay.com/group/customer/dxp/downloads/digital-enterprise). 
You'll need the following files: 

- `liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-[version].war`: @product@ WAR file

- `liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-dependencies-[version].zip`: @product@
  dependencies

- `liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-osgi-[version].zip`: @product@ OSGi
  dependencies

Without any further ado, get ready to install @product@ in WebSphere! 

## Preparing WebSphere for @product@ [](id=preparing-websphere-for-liferay-dxp)

When the application server binaries have been installed, start the *Profile 
Management Tool* to create a profile appropriate for @product@. 

1.  Click *Create...*, choose *Application Server*, and then click *Next*. 

2.  Click the *Advanced* profile creation option and then click *Next*. Why 
    Advanced? You can specify your own values for settings such as the location 
    of the profile and names of the profile, node and host. You can assign your 
    own ports. You can optionally choose whether to deploy the administrative 
    console and sample application and also add web-server definitions if you 
    wish. Web server definitions are used with IBM HTTP Server. See the 
    WebSphere documentation for more information about these options. 

    ![Figure 1: Choose the Advanced profile option to specify your own settings.](../../images-dxp/websphere-01-profile.png)

3.  Check the box *Deploy the administrative console*. This gives you a 
    web-based UI for working with your application server. Skip the default 
    applications. You'd only install these on a development machine. Click 
    *Next*. 

4.  Set the profile name and location. Ensure you specify a performance tuning 
    setting other than *Development*, since you're installing a production 
    server. See the WebSphere documentation for more information about 
    performance tuning settings. Click *Next*. 

5.  Choose node, server, and host names for your server. These will be specific 
    to your environment. Click *Next*. 

6.  Administrative security in WebSphere is a way to restrict who has access to 
    the administrative tools. You may want to have it enabled in your 
    environment so that a user name and password are required to administer the 
    WebSphere server. See WebSphere's documentation for more information. Click 
    *Next*. 

7.  Each profile needs a security certificate, which comes next in the wizard. 
    If you don't have certificates already, choose the option to generate a 
    personal certificate and a signing certificate and click *Next*. 

8.  Once the certificates are generated, set a password for your keystore. Click 
    *Next*. 

9.  Now you can customize the ports this server profile uses. Be sure to choose 
    ports that are open on your machine. When choosing ports, the wizard detects 
    existing WebSphere installations and if it finds activity, it increments 
    ports by one. 

10. Choose whether you want this profile started when the machine starts. Click 
    *Next*. 

11. WebSphere ships with IBM HTTP Server, which is a re-branded version of 
    Apache. Choose whether you want a web server definition, so that this JVM 
    receives requests forwarded from the HTTP server. See WebSphere's 
    documentation for details on this. When finished, click *Next*. 

12. The wizard then shows you a summary of what you selected, enabling you to 
    keep your choices or go back and change something. When you're satisfied, 
    click *Next*. 

WebSphere then creates your profile and finishes with a message telling you the 
profile was created successfully. Awesome! Your profile is complete. Now there 
are a few things you need to configure in your application server. 

![Figure 2: Example of the settings before creating the profile.](../../images-dxp/websphere-02-profile.png)

### Configuring the WebSphere Application Server [](id=configuring-the-websphere-application-server)

In this version of WebSphere, servlet filters are not initialized on web 
application startup, but rather, on first access. This can cause problems when 
deploying certain apps to @product@. To configure servlet filters to initialize 
on application startup (i.e., deployment), you need to set the following 
`webcontainer` custom properties in your WebSphere application server: 

    com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.initFilterBeforeInitServlet = true
    com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokeFilterInitAtStartup = true

To set `webcontainer` custom properties in the WebSphere application server, 
follow the instructions 
[here in WebSphere's documentation](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rss=180&uid=swg21284395). 

### Setting up JVM Parameters for Liferay DXP [](id=setting-up-jvm-parameters-for-liferay-dxp)

Next, in the WebSphere profile you created for @product@, you must set an 
argument that supports @product@'s Java memory requirements. You'll modify this 
file: 

    [Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/your-profile/config/cells/your-cell/nodes/your-node/servers/your-server/server.xml

Add `maximumHeapSize="2048"` inside the `jvmEntries` tag. For example: 

    <jvmEntries xmi:id="JavaVirtualMachine_1183122130078" ... maximumHeapSize="2048">

+$$$

**Note:** The JVM parameters used here are defaults intended for production 
systems development purposes. Administrators can change the settings to other 
values that best address their specific environments. These will need to be 
tuned depending on need. 

$$$

Administrators can set the UTF-8 and GMT time zone properties in the
`server.xml` file. This is required or else special characters will not be
parsed correctly. Add the following inside the `jvmEntries` tag:

    <jvmEntries xmi:id="JavaVirtualMachine_1183122130078" ...genericJvmArguments="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Duser.timezone=GMT">

+$$$

**Important:** For @product@ to work properly, the application server JVM must 
use the `GMT` time zone and `UTF-8` file encoding. 

$$$

Alternately, you can set the UTF-8 and GMT properties from the WebSphere Admin
Console. (See below.)

### Removing the secureSessionCookie Tag [](id=removing-the-securesessioncookie-tag)

In the same profile, you should delete a problematic `secureSessionCookie` tag 
that can cause @product@ startup errors. Note that this is just a default 
setting; once @product@ is installed, you should tune it appropriately based on 
your usage. 

In `[Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/your-profile/config/cells/your-cell/cell.xml`, 
Delete the `secureSessionCookie` tag containing 
`xmi:id="SecureSessionCookie_1"`. 

If this tag is not removed, an error similar to the one here may occur: 

    WSVR0501E: Error creating component com.ibm.ws.runtime.component.CompositionUnitMgrImpl@d74fa901    
    com.ibm.ws.exception.RuntimeWarning: com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.exception.WebAppNotLoadedException: Failed to load webapp: Failed to load webapp: SRVE8111E: The application, LiferayEAR, is trying to modify a cookie which matches a pattern in the restricted programmatic session cookies list [domain=*, name=JSESSIONID, path=/].

## Installing @product@'s Dependencies [](id=installing-liferay-dxps-dependencies)

You must now install @product@'s dependencies. Recall that earlier you 
downloaded two ZIP files containing these dependencies. Install their contents 
now: 

1. `liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-dependencies-[version].zip`: Unzip this file 
   and place its contents in your WebSphere application server's 
   `[Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/lib/ext` folder. If you have a JDBC 
   database driver `JAR`, copy it to this location as well. 

2. `liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-osgi-[version].zip`: Unzip this file and 
   place its contents in the `[Liferay Home]/osgi` folder (create this folder if 
   it doesn't exist). This is typically 
   `[Install Location]/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/your-profile/liferay/osgi`. 

Before starting the server, verify that all the following jars have been copied 
to the correct folders. Optional jars are available (italics) and are used to 
optimize Liferay performance which must be added to this folder. Required jars 
in bold are from the `liferay-digital-enterprise-dependencies-7.0-ga1 zip`. The 
following files should be present within the `lib/ext` (WebSphere Application) 
folder: 

1. `activation.jar`
2. `com.liferay.registry.api-1.0.4.jar`
3. `hsql.jar`
4. A JDBC database jar (e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, IBM DB2, Postgres)
5. `persistence.jar`
6. `portal-kernel.jar`
7. `portlet.jar`

The following folders should be present within the `/liferay/osgi` folder: 

1. `Configs`
2. `Core`
3. `Marketplace`
4. `Target-platform`
5. `Test`

Once you've installed these dependencies, start the server profile you created 
for @product@. Once it starts, you're ready to configure your database. 

## Database Configuration [](id=database-configuration)

If you want WebSphere to manage the database connections, follow the 
instructions below. Note this is not necessary if you're planning on using 
@product@'s standard database configuration; in that case, skip this section. 
You'll set your database information in @product@'s setup wizard after the 
install. 

+$$$

**Note:** Although @product@'s embedded database is fine for testing purposes, 
you **should not** use it for production @product@ instances. 

$$$

    ![Figure 3: WebSphere JDBC providers](../../images-dxp/websphere-jdbc-providers.png)

1.  Start WebSphere. 

2.  Open the Administrative Console and log in. 

3.  Click *Resources &rarr; JDBC Providers*. 

4.  Select a scope and then click *New*. 

5.  Select your database type, provider type, and implementation type. If you 
    select a predefined database, the wizard fills in the name and description 
    fields for you. If the database you want to use isn't listed, select 
    *User-defined* from the *Database type* field and then fill in the 
    *Implementation Class Name*. For example, if you are using MySQL, select 
    *Database type* &rarr; *User-defined*, and then enter 
    `com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlConnectionPoolDataSource` in 
    *Implementation Class Name*. Click *Next* when you are finished. 

6.  Clear any text in the classpath settings. You already copied the necessary 
    JARs to a location on the server's classpath. Click *Next*. 

7.  Review your settings and click *Finish*. The final configuration should look 
    like this: 

    ![Figure 4: Completed JDBC provider configurations.](../../images-dxp/websphere-03.png)

8.  Click your new provider configuration when it appears in the table, and then 
    click *Data Sources* under *Additional Properties*. Click *New*. 

9.  Enter *liferaydatabasesource* in the *Data source name* field and 
    `jdbc/LiferayPool` in the *JNDI name* field. Click *Next*. 

10. Click *Next* in the remaining screens of the wizard to accept the default 
    values. Then review your changes and click *Finish*. 

11. Click the data source when it appears in the table and then click *Custom 
    Properties*. Now click the *Show Filter Function* button. This is the second 
    from last of the small icons under the *New* and *Delete* buttons. 

12. Type *user* into the search terms and click *Go*. 

    ![Figure 5: Modifying data source properties in WebSphere](../../images-dxp/websphere-database-properties.png)

13. Select the *user* property and give it the value of the user name to your 
    database. Click *OK* and save to master configuration. 

14. Do another filter search for the *url* property. Give this property a value 
    that points to your database. For example, a MySQL URL would look like this: 

        jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useFastDateParsing=false

    Click *OK* and save to master configuration. 

15. Do another filter search for the *password* property. Enter the password for 
    the user ID you added earlier as the value for this property. Click *OK* and 
    save to master configuration. 

16. Go back to the data source page by clicking it in the breadcrumb trail. 
    Click the *Test Connection* button. It should connect successfully. 

Once you've set up your database, you can set up your mail session. 

## Mail Configuration [](id=mail-configuration)

If you want WebSphere to manage your mail sessions, use the following procedure. 
If you want to use @product@'s built-in mail sessions, you can skip this 
section. 

### Creating a WebSphere-Managed Mail Session (Optional) [](id=creating-a-websphere-managed-mail-session-optional)

1. Click *Resources &rarr; Mail &rarr; Mail Providers*. 

2. Click the Built-In Mail Provider for your node and server. 

3. Click *Mail Sessions* and then click the *New* button. 

4. Give your mail session a name of *liferaymail* and a JNDI name of 
   `mail/MailSession`. Fill in the correct information for your mail server in 
   the sections *Outgoing Mail Properties* and *Incoming Mail Properties*. Click 
   *OK* and then save to the master configuration. 

5. Click your mail session when it appears in the table and select *Custom 
   Properties* under the *Additional Properties* section. Set any other JavaMail 
   properties required by your mail server, such as the protocol, ports, whether 
   to use SSL, and so on. 

5. Click *Security &rarr; Global Security* and de-select *Use Java 2 security to 
   restrict application access to local resources* if it is selected. Click 
   *Apply*. 

Note that you may also need to retrieve a SSL certificate from your mail server 
and add it to WebSphere's trust store. See WebSphere's documentation for 
instructions on this. 

### Verifying WebSphere Mail Provider [](id=verifying-websphere-mail-provider)

To validate that the mail session has been configured correctly, there are a 
number of ways to test this once the WAR has been deployed, the server has 
started, and the user has signed in as the system administrator. One quick way 
to validate is to create a new user with a valid email account. The newly 
created user should receive an email notification. The logs should display that 
the SMTP server has been pinged with the correct port number listed. 

## Enable Cookies for HTTP Sessions [](id=enable-cookies-http-sessions)

WebSphere 8.5.5.9 restricts cookies to HTTPS sessions by default. If you're 
using HTTP instead, this prevents users from signing in to @product@ and 
displays the following error in the console: 

    20:07:14,021 WARN  [WebContainer : 1][SecurityPortletContainerWrapper:341]
    User 0 is not allowed to access URL http://localhost:9081/web/guest/home and
    portlet com_liferay_login_web_portlet_LoginPortlet

This occurs because @product@ can't use the HTTPS cookie when you use HTTP. The 
end result is that new sessions are created on each page refresh. Follow these 
steps to resolve this issue in WebSphere: 

1. Click *Application Servers* &rarr; *server1* &rarr; *Session Management*
   &rarr; Enable Cookies 

2. De-select *Restrict cookies to HTTPS sessions* 

3. Click *Apply* 

4. Click *Save* 

## Enable UTF-8 [](id=enable-utf-8)

If you did not add the `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` property in the `server.xml`, you
can do so in the Administrative Console.

1. Click *Application Servers* &rarr; *server1* &rarr; *Process definition*.

2. Click *Java Virtual Machine* under *Additional Properties*.

3. Enter `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` in the *Generic JVM arguments* field.

4. Click *Apply* and then *Save* to master configuration.

Once the changes have been saved, @product@ can parse special characters if
there is localized content.

## Deploy @product@ [](id=deploy-liferay-dxp)

Now you're ready to deploy @product@! 

1. In WebSphere's administrative console, click *Applications* &rarr; *New 
   Application* &rarr; *New Enterprise Application*. 

2. Browse to the @product@ `.war` file, select it, and click *Next*. 

3. Leave *Fast Path* selected and click *Next*. Ensure that *Distribute
   Application* has been checked and click *Next* again. 

4. Choose the WebSphere runtimes and/or clusters where you want @product@ 
   deployed. Click *Next*. 

5. Select the virtual host to deploy @product@ on and click *Next*. 

6. Map @product@ to the root context (/) and click *Next*. 

7. Select the *metadata-complete attribute* setting that you want to use and 
   click *Next*. 

8. Ensure that you have made all the correct choices and click *Finish*. When 
   @product@ has installed, click *Save to Master Configuration*. 

   ![Figure 6: Review your deployment options before deploying.](../../images-dxp/websphere-deploy-dxp.png)

You've now installed @product@! 

## Setting the JDK Version for Compiling JSPs [](id=setting-the-jdk-version-for-compiling-jsps)

@product@ requires that its JSPs are compiled on Java 8. To ensure that
WebSphere does this, shut down WebSphere after you've deployed the @product@
`.war` file. Navigate to the `WEB_INF` folder and add the following setting to
the `ibm-web-ext.xml` or in most cases the `ibm-web-ext.xmi` file:

    <jsp-attribute name="jdkSourceLevel" value="18" />

The exact path to the `ibm-web-ext.xmi` file depends on your WebSphere
installation location and @product@ version, but here's an example:

	/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/config/cells/localhostNode01Cell/applications/liferayXX.ear/deployments/liferayXX/liferayXX.war/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xmi

Note that the @product@ `.war` comes pre-packaged with the `ibm-web-ext.xmi`
file; this format is functionally the same as `.xml` and WebSphere recognizes both
formats. For more general information on how WebSphere compiles JSPs see IBM's
official documentation for 
[WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/rweb_jspengine.html).

Now restart WebSphere. 

## Enabling Security for Portal Access Control Lists [](id=enabling-security-for-portal-access-control-lists)

When you are ready to start using apps from Liferay Marketplace, you must 
enable Liferay's Portal Access Control Lists (PACL) to enforce security policies 
on Marketplace applications. To do so, you must enable Java Security on your 
WebSphere server and specify a security policy to grant @product@ access to your 
server. 

In WebSphere's administrative console, go to *Security* &rarr; 
*Global Security*. Check the box to enable Java 2 security, and click *Apply*. 
Save to the master configuration. 

![Figure 7: Enabling security can be done by checking one box, but it still needs to be configured.](../../images-dxp/websphere-security.png)

Now you must configure the security policy for the IBM JRE that WebSphere runs 
on. With your WebSphere server shut down, open the following security policy 
file: 

    [WebSphere-Install-Location]/java_1.8_64/jre/lib/security/java.policy

Replace this file's contents with the following configuration: 

    grant {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

This configuration opens all permissions. As best practices, opening all 
permissions when starting Liferay Digital Enterprise 7.0 for the first time 
allows for the creation of all required processes. Users can change security 
settings later and restrict which plugins have access. (Users have the options 
of using either the application server's security policies or Liferay DXP's.) 
See this article 
[concerning a Known Issues when generating PACL](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/knowledge-base/-/kb/156397). 

Once this permission has been set, users can start @product@. 

## Start @product@ [](id=start-liferay-dxp)

1. If you plan to use @product@'s setup wizard, skip to the next step. If you 
   wish to use WebSphere's data source and mail session, create a file called 
   `portal-ext.properties` in your Liferay Home folder. Place the following 
   configuration in the file: 

        jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool
        mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession
        setup.wizard.enabled=false

2. In the WebSphere administrative console, navigate to *Enterprise 
   Applications*, select the @product@ application, and click *Start*. While 
   @product@ is starting, WebSphere displays a spinny little graphic. Don't 
   watch it too closely, or you might get hypnotized. 

3. In @product@'s setup wizard, select and configure your database type. Click 
   *Finish* when you're done. @product@ then creates the tables it needs in the 
   database. 

Congratulations! You've installed @product@ on WebSphere!
