# Liferay Enterprise Search [](id=installing-a-search-engine)

Search engines are a critical component of your @product@ installation. They allow
you to provide documents in an index that can quickly be searched, rather than
relying on expensive database queries. For more fundamental material on search
and indexing in @product@, read
[here](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-liferay-search).
If you're here, you probably know the basics already and want to get started on
configuring a search engine for your @product-ver@ deployment. 

@product@ ships with Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine.
Elasticsearch is well supported and will almost certainly meet any search and
indexing need you have. For deployment settings, learn to configure a
standalone, or remote, Elasticsearch server or cluster
[here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-elasticsearch-for-liferay-0).

If you need to use Solr, it's also supported in @product@, and you can read more
about its configuration [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-solr).
