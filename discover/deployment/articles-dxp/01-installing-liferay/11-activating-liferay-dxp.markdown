# Activating Liferay DXP [](id=activating-liferay-dxp)

Liferay now offers a new way of registering its products. Beginning with
@product-ver@, activation keys are managed through _Liferay Connected Services_
(LCS for short). Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set
of tools and services that lets administrators manage and monitor their
@product@ instances. LCS can install fix packs, monitor each
@product@ instance's performance, 
[activate each @product@ instance](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/activating-liferay-dxp),
and help manage @product@ subscriptions automatically.

To start using @product@, each instance must be associated with the
subscriptions on LCS. For more information, go to: 
[Managing @product@ with LCS](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services).
