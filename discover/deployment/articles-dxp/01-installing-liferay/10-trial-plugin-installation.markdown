# @product@ Trial Plugin Installation [](id=liferay-dxp-trial-plugin-installation)

For Liferay customers who are evaluating Liferay Portal EE on a trial
basis, **the plugins can be accessed from within the Marketplace section
of the Control Panel in the product**. 

*At a later date, the Marketplace website on Liferay.COM will be accessible to
Liferay Portal EE Trial customers. For now, please access EE Plugins through the
portal installation itself.*  

## The Installation Process [](id=the-installation-process)

**1)** Sign into your Liferay.COM account (LRDC) on the home page. If you

**5)** Trial users have access to the Customer Portal during their trial, with
the exception of our customer Knowledge Base and LESA, our support ticketing

[Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace) on Liferay.COM
(LRDC).

Note: We are currently working on providing access to @product@ Plugins on the
Marketplace website for @product@ Trial customers, which would also include
access from within the portal installation.

## FAQ [](id=faq)

**Q:** Where are the "@product@ Trial Plugins"?

**A:** There is no such thing. The @product@ Plugins in Liferay Marketplace are
the same ones that you get to try out with your @product@ Trial license for your
portal. The @product@ license (Trial or official @product@ Subscriber) gives you access to the
@product@ plugins. (Also, there is no difference code-wise or release-wise between a
@product@ Trial installation and a regular @product@ non-Trial
installation. The only difference is the license.)

**Q:** Why can't I go to liferay.com/marketplace? Why can't I "purchase" from the
Marketplace site?

**A:** DXP Trial users must use the Marketplace accessed from within the
product's Control Panel (instructions above). You do not need to
"purchase" any DXP plugins because if you access Marketplace from within
the Control Panel, Marketplace sees that you have an DXP
license installed and gives access to DXP plugins. Official DXP
Subscription customers (i.e., non Trial) will be able to log into
liferay.com with their designated DXP subscriber login and access all DXP
plugins through the Marketplace website. 

**Q:** Why are the plugins under the "Purchased" tab? If I click on the
"DXP Marketplace" link, it does not allow me to get the DXP plugins.

**A:** Once you're signed into the Store, click on the *Purchased* tab,
then click on the *EE* subtab.

**Q:** What happens when DXP Trial customers become official Liferay
Digital Experience subscribers?

**A:** They will still be able to complete the above process, or they
can also visit the [Liferay Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace).

**Q:** Do DXP Trial customers get the DXP source code?

**A:** No, they can only install the plugin. The DXP source code becomes
available once they are official @product@ Enterprise subscribers.

**Q:** Can this process of installing DXP plugins be used from Liferay Portal CE
(Community Edition)?

**A:** No, the Marketplace must detect that you are running @product@.
