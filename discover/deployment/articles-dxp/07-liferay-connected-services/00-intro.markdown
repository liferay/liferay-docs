# Managing @product@ with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets 
you manage and monitor your @product@ instances. LCS can automatically install 
the fix packs that you choose, monitor your @product@ instances' performance, activate 
your @product@ instances, and help you manage your @product@ subscriptions. In other words, 
LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is @product@. Even better, the 
features of LCS work regardless of whether your @product@ instance is on a single 
discreet server or distributed across a node. It's like having a single butler 
that can serve several mansions at once! You can find more information 
about LCS on its 
[official product page](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-connected-services).
