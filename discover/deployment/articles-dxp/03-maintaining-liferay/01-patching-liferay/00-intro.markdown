# Patching @product@ [](id=patching-liferay)

While we strive for perfection with every release of @product@, the reality

perfect as originally intended. But we've planned for that. Included with every
Liferay bundle is a Patching Tool that can handle the installation of two types
of patches: fix packs and hotfixes.
