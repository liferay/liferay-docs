# Managing Liferay with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services that lets you 
manage and monitor your Liferay installations. While Liferay's patching tool 
lets you apply fix packs and other updates, the install process is still manual. 
LCS simplifies this process by automatically installing any fix packs that you 
*choose*. That last point is an important one--LCS won't install anything that 
you don't specifically choose for installation. You still have control over what 
gets applied to your Liferay installations. LCS just automates the process by 
enabling one-click downloading and updating. You can also use LCS to monitor the 
performance of your Liferay instances. This includes data on pages, portlets, 
memory usage, JVM performance, and much more. Even better, the features of LCS 
work regardless of whether your Liferay instance is on a single discreet server 
or distributed across a node. 

Before going any further, you should make sure that your Liferay instances meet 
the requirements for LCS--you must be running Liferay Portal 6.1 GA 3, or 6.2 GA
1 or above. Using LCS to apply fix packs and other updates is an EE only 
feature. The monitoring features of LCS are available to both Liferay CE and EE.

Also, you should take note of a few key terms used throughout this guide: 

- *Project*: Represents a group of users belonging to a company or organization. 
  For example, a project can consist of all the users from a project team or 
  business unit, or it can include the entire company.
- *Environment*: Represents a physical cluster of servers or a virtual or 
  logical aggregation of servers.
- *Server*: Describes a concrete portal instance. It can be a standalone server 
  or a cluster node.

As you go through this guide, you'll cover the following sections on LCS:

- LCS Account Setup
- Portal Preconfiguration (Liferay 6.1 GA3 only)
- Patching Tool Configuration (EE only)
- LCS Client Configuration
- Using LCS

Next, you'll get started by setting up your LCS account.
