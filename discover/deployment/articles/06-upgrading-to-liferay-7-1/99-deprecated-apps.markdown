# Deprecated Apps in 7.1: What to Do

During the development of any software product, it's sometimes necessary to stop 
development on or remove outdated or unpopular features. @product-ver@ is no 
different. Liferay has deprecated several apps in @product-ver@. It's important 
to note what, exactly, *deprecated* means here. 

+$$$

**Note:** All apps deprecated by Liferay are no longer in active development. 
You should therefore plan to stop using these apps. Such apps, however, may 
still be available for download.

There are 3 types of deprecated apps: 

1.  Deprecated apps that remain in @product@, but will be removed in a future 
    release. 

2.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@, yet are still 
    available for download via 
    [Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) 
    or 
    [Liferay's public Nexus repository](https://repository.liferay.com). For 
    instructions on installing apps, see the 
    [Managing Apps](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/managing-apps) 
    documentation. 

3.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from @product@, and aren't available 
    for download. 

This article lists the apps deprecated in @product-ver@, and tells you if 
they're still available.
