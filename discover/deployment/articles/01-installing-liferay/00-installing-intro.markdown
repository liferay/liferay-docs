# Deploying @product@

@product@ is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
respect to database and application server support. @product@ supports a wide
variety of databases and application servers, freeing you to use the ones you
think are best. @product@ also scales very well. You can install @product@ on a
shared hosting account, on a multi-node cluster running a commercial application
server, or on anything in between. In fact, @product@ is used successfully in all
of these scenarios every day. Some features, such as clustering, are only
available with Liferay's Digital Experience Platform.

You'll find that because @product@ is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application server,
you can use your application server's deployment tools to install @product@. If
you don't already have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured
application servers with @product@ already installed on them. They're easy to 
install and with a small amount of configuration can be made into 
production-ready systems.

Read on to learn how you can prepare to install @product@.
