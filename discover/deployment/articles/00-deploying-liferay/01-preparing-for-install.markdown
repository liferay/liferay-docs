# Preparing for Install [](id=preparing-for-install)

Installing @product@ is easy. But before you begin, you should answer a few
questions.

- Which version of Liferay will you install?
- On which application server will you install @product@?
- Can you install a @product@ bundle or do you need to install @product@ on an
  existing application server?
- Which database will you use with @product@?
- How do you plan to store your data?
- Can your network support @product@?
<!--
- Will you enable Liferay's PACL security feature?
-->

Next, you'll answer these questions and learn the basic steps for installing
@product@.

## Obtaining @product@ [](id=obtaining-product)

Anyone can download @product@ from [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com).
Click Product &rarr; *Downloads*, and you'll be able to download either the
open source version of @product@ or a trial of the commercial version in several
different formats. These include our convenient bundles as well as `.war` files
for installing @product@ on your application server of choice.

Liferay enterprise subscribers can download Liferay DXP from the
[Customer Portal](https://www.liferay.com/group/customer).

So what is a @product@ bundle anyway? A @product@ bundle is an application server
with @product@ pre-installed. Using a bundle is the easiest way to install
@product@. @product@ is bundled with a number of application servers; all you need
to do is choose the one that best fits your needs. If you don't currently have
an application server preference, consider starting with the Tomcat bundle.
Tomcat is one of the most lightweight and straightforward bundles to configure.
If you have an open source application server preference, choose the server you
prefer from the available @product@ bundles. You must have a JDK (Java
Development Kit) installed prior to launching @product@.

Please note that @product@ is not able to provide application server bundles for
proprietary application servers such as WebLogic or WebSphere, because the
licenses for these servers don't allow for redistribution. @product@'s commercial
offering, however, runs just as well on these application servers as it does on
the others. You'll need to follow our manual installation procedure using a
`.war` file to install @product@ on proprietary application servers.

Once you have @product@, you can plan out your installation. First, prepare your
database. Second, install @product@. Third, configure your network. Fourth,
configure search. You can install @product@ either by using a bundle or by
installing it manually on your existing application server. Next, we'll go over
the steps it takes to install @product@.

## @product@ Installation Steps [](id=liferay-installation-steps)

Before you begin installing @product@, you should review these basic
installation steps:

1.  Choose a database server to use with @product@ and create a new database.
    Determine whether you want @product@ to manage your database connection or
    your application server to manage your database connection. We recommend
    that you let @product@ manage your database connection. @product@ can
    connect with several open source or enterprise level document repositories.

2.  Gather mail credentials for sending email notifications to users. Determine
    whether you want @product@ to manage your mail session or your application
    server to manage your mail session. @product@ provides a built-in mail
    session but also supports a JNDI mail session. We recommend that you let
    @product@ manage your mail session.

3.  Install either a @product@ bundle or install @product@ on an existing
    application server (further instructions below).

4.  Choose IPv4 or IPv6. Determine which address format is best for your network
    (further instructions below). 

5.  Determine how you'll configure Elasticsearch. @product@'s default embedded
    configuration is not supported for production use, so you must install
    Elasticsearch separately, either on the same infrastructure or on its own.
    <!--6. Determine whether you'll use Liferay Marketplace or other third party
    applications. If you will, you should enable Liferay's Plugin Access Control
    List (PACL) security feature.-->

7.  Configure ports (optional). Liferay's application server (e.g., Tomcat or
    Wildfly) uses certain ports for purposes like handling incoming HTTP
    requests, HTTPS requests, or AJP requests, etc. If you start your
    application server in debug mode, there's a port listening for a debugger to
    connect. If desired, you can configure these ports. Please refer to your
    application server's documentation for information on its default ports and
    how to configure them.

    Liferay also provides access to its OSGi framework through a configurable
    port:

    `module.framework.properties.osgi.console=localhost:11311`

    You can override this default property by copying the line above to your
    `LIFERAY_HOME/portal-ext.properties` file and adjusting the port number.

We'll go through the steps in order, so first we'll look at the @product@
database.

## Step 1: Choose a Database Server and Create a New Database [](id=step-1-choose-a-database-server-and-create-a-new-database)

The recommended way of setting up your @product@ database is also the simplest.
@product@ takes care of just about everything. You only need to take two simple
steps:

1.  Create a blank database encoded with the character set UTF-8. @product@ is a
    multilingual application and needs UTF-8 encoding to display all of its
    supported character sets.

    +$$$

    **Note:** If you plan to migrate from one database vendor to another,
    [configure the database to use the default query result order you expect for entities @product@ lists](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/sort-order-changed-with-a-different-database). 

    $$$

2.  Create a database user for accessing this database. Grant this database user
    all rights, including the rights to create and drop tables, to the blank
    @product@ database.

@product@ uses this database user's credentials to connect to the @product@
database either directly or through its application server. During its initial
startup, @product@ creates the tables it needs in the database you just created.
It does this automatically, complete with indexes.

This is the recommended way to set up @product@. It enables @product@ to
maintain its database automatically during upgrades or when various @product@
plugins that create database tables of their own are installed. This method is
by far the best way to set up your @product@ database.

If you choose to set up @product@'s database with the recommended permissions
described in this section, you can skip to the next section.

+$$$

**Warning:** The instructions below are not ideal for @product@
installations. This procedure is documented here so that enterprises with more
restrictive standards can install @product@ with stricter (but sub-optimal)
database settings. If it's at all possible, we recommend that you use the
method described in the previous section instead of the procedure outlined
below.

$$$

Even though @product@ can create its database automatically, some enterprises
prefer *not* to allow the database user configured in an application server to
have the database permissions necessary for @product@ and its plugins to
maintain their tables. For these organizations, Select, Insert, Update and
Delete are the only allowed permissions. Thus, in this section we explain how to
set up the database manually. If your organization *is* willing to grant the
@product@ database user the permissions to create and drop tables in the
database--and this is the recommended configuration--then simply use the
recommended configuration described in the previous section.

1.  Create a new, blank, database for @product@.

2.  Grant full rights to do anything to the @product@ database to the @product@
    database user.

3.  Install @product@ and start it so that it automatically populates its
    database.

4.  Once the database has been populated with the @product@ tables, remove the
    permissions for creating and dropping tables from the @product@ database
    user.

There are some caveats to running @product@ like this. Many @product@ plugins
create new tables when they're deployed. Additionally, @product@ has an
automatic database upgrade function that runs when @product@ is upgraded. If the
@product@ database user doesn't have enough rights to create/modify/drop tables
in the database, you must grant those rights to the ID before you deploy one of
these plugins or start upgrading @product@. Once the tables are created or the
upgrade is complete, you can remove those rights until the next deploy or
upgrade. Additionally, your own developers might create plugins that need to
create their own tables. These are just like @product@'s plugins that do the
same thing, and they cannot be installed if @product@ can't create database
tables. If you wish to install these plugins, you will need to grant rights to
create tables in the database each time before you attempt to install them.

@product@ offers several configurations to store Documents and Media files by
setting the `dl.store.impl=` property. Available options are Simple File System
Store, Advanced File System Store, CMIS Store, DBStore, JCRStore, and Amazon
S3Store. In addition, @product@ can be connected to various open source and
enterprise-level document repositories. All of the repositories are connected to
@product@ through hooks available on Liferay Marketplace (see below). 

Once you have your database and document repository ready, you can install
@product@ on your server.

## Step Two: Gather Your Mail Credentials [](id=step-two-gather-your-mail-credentials)

@product@ uses a mail server to send email notifications. As part of the
install, therefore, you will need to have credentials that @product@ can use to
connect to your mail server. Specifically, you'll need to have the following
information: 

- Incoming POP Server and port
- POP User Name
- POP Password
- Outgoing SMTP Server and port
- SMTP User Name
- SMTP Password
- A list of JavaMail properties that would override a default configuration

Once you've gathered this information, you're ready to move on to the next step. 

## Step Three: Install [](id=step-three-install)

The next step is to install @product@. You can do this in one of two ways: by
[installing @product@ bundled with an application server](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-product),
or by
[installing @product@ manually on an existing application server](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-liferay-manually).
Each @product@ installation's 
[Liferay Home contains several folders](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-product#liferay-home).

By far the easiest way to get @product@ installed is to use a bundle. Though
bundles are pre-packaged for demo purposes, it is very easy to turn them into
full, production-ready @product@ instances. 

## Step Four: Network Configuration [](id=step-four-network)

@product@ supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address formats. You must
[choose between IPv4 or IPv6](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/choosing-ipv4-or-ipv6).
By default, @product@ uses IPv4 addresses. If you are using IPv6, you will have to configure @product@. There are two simple steps. 

1.  In the application server's environment settings, set
    `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false`. 

2.  Create a `portal-ext.properties` file in your portal's
    [Liferay Home folder](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-product#liferay-home)
    (if one does not already exist) and set the `tunnel.servlet.hosts.allowed`
    property to the target hosts you want to allow (e.g., _0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1_). 

## Step Five: Configure Elasticsearch [](id=step-five-configure-elastic-search)

@product@ by default ships with an embedded version of Elasticsearch. While this
configuration works well for demo purposes, it is not supported in a production
installation. After you install @product@, you'll need to configure it to
connect to a standalone Elasticsearch server or cluster. Depending on the size
of your installation, this standalone instance of Elasticsearch can reside
either on the same machine you have @product@ on or a different machine. For
performance purposes, it is better to
[install Elasticsearch on a separate machine](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-elasticsearch).

## Step Six: Liferay Marketplace and Portal Security [](id=step-six-liferay-marketplace-and-portal-security)

The Liferay Marketplace is an integral part of the @product@ experience. The
Marketplace plugin is required to be installed on @product@. The Marketplace
plugin enables a host of features that extend beyond just access to the online
Liferay Marketplace. Some of the key features the Marketplace plugin enables are

-   Liferay Marketplace: direct access to our online Marketplace
-   App Manager: ability to install, uninstall, and update apps
-   Bundled Apps: easily manage apps that may come bundled with your @product@
-   Developer Apps: ability to manage apps that you're developing
-   License Manager: streamlined license management for your @product@ and apps

<!-- TODO uncomment when PACL is supported. Jim
You will want to make sure Portal Access Control Lists are enabled if you intend
to download and install apps from Marketplace. This is an additional layer of
security that defines various permissions that apps may or may not have.
--> 

The portal installation process deploys and registers the Marketplace plugin
automatically. If you're installing @product@ in an environment that would
prevent this from happening, you'll have to perform one of several workarounds. 

Now that you know where you're headed, you can install @product@. If you have
decided to install @product@ using a bundle, continue with the next section. If
you're installing @product@ manually, skip to the section for your application
server of choice. Once you have @product@ installed manually or via a bundle,
you can move on to 
[using @product@'s Setup Wizard](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-product##using-liferays-setup-wizard),
[configuring mail](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-product#configuring-mail),
and 
[installing Elasticsearch](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-1/installing-elasticsearch).
