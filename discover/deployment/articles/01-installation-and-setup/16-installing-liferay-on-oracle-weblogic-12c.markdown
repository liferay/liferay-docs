# Installing Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c (12.1.2 and higher) [](id=installing-liferay-on-oracle-weblogic-12c-12-1-2-and-h)

In this section, you'll learn how to install Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c.
Since you're using Oracle WebLogic, you may wonder if Liferay supports XA
transactions. Liferay doesn't require XA transactions, but it supports XA.
Let's get acquainted with how Liferay fits in with your current WebLogic domain. 

Liferay by default defines *Liferay Home* as one folder above the domain in
which you'll be installing Liferay. For example, if your domain location is
`/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/base_domain`, then your
Liferay Home is `/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains`.

For this section, the variable `$WL_HOME` refers to the location of your
WebLogic server installation (e.g., `/Oracle/Middleware/Oracle_Home/wlserver`). 

Before you begin, make sure to download the latest Liferay `.war` file and
Liferay Portal dependencies from
[http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/additional-files).
The Liferay `.war` file is called `liferay-portal-[version].war` and
the dependencies file is called `liferay-portal-dependencies-[version].zip`.

These instructions assume you've already configured a domain and server and that
you have access to the WebLogic console.

If you still have the `mainWebApp` module installed in your WebLogic server
installation, remove it before proceeding with the instructions in this section.

Let's get started by installing the `.jar` files Liferay needs.

## Dependency Jars [](id=dependency-jars)

Liferay needs the driver `.jar` file applicable for the database you plan to use
for Liferay. Liferay also needs the `.jar` files contained in the Liferay
Dependencies Archive. All of these `.jar` files must go into your domain's
global classpath. 

1.  Navigate to your domain's `lib` folder. Extract the dependency `.jar` files
    from the Liferay Dependencies Archive to your domain's `lib` folder.

2.  If WebLogic does not already have access to the JDBC driver for your
    database, copy the driver to your domain's `lib` folder as well.

So far so good. The `.jar` files on which your Liferay Portal will depend are in
place. 

Let's proceed with configuring WebLogic.

## Configuring WebLogic [](id=configuring-weblogic)

You need to make the following adjustments in your configuration to support
Liferay:

- Set WebLogic Server's memory arguments.
- Set the maximum size for Java's permanent generation space.
- Set the file encoding.
- Enable Lucene support.
- Enable AspectJ support.

You can set WebLogic Server's memory arguments in your `setDomainEnv.[cmd|sh]`
environment script file found in your domain's `bin` folder. For the Sun JVM,
set the WLS memory arguments for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures to at least
`-Xms256m -Xmx1024m`. For all other JVMs, set the 64 bit and 32 bit WLS memory
arguments to `-Xms512m -Xmx512m` respectively. 

Set the permanent generation space for 64 bit and 32 bit architectures
to `-XX:PermSize=256m`.

Lastly, make sure to specify UTF-8 for Java's file encoding, by including Java
property `-Dfile.encoding=UTF8`.

To specify all of these settings on Windows, for example, you'd edit your
`setDomainEnv.cmd` file and find the call to the `commEnv.cmd` script. After
this call, you'd update your memory arguments and permanent generation space
settings to be like the following code: 

    ...
    if "%JAVA_VENDOR"=="Sun" (
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms256m -Xmx1024m
    ) else (
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_64BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
        set WLS_MEM_ARGS_32BIT=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
    )
    ...
    set MEM_PERM_SIZE_64BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m
    set MEM_PERM_SIZE_32BIT=-XX:PermSize=256m

Later in the `setDomainEnv.cmd` file's clustering support section, you'd set
the UTF-8 file encoding by appending `-Dfile.encoding=UTF8` to the front of the
list of Java property values. Here's what that setting could look like: 

    set JAVA_PROPERTIES=-Dfile.encoding=utf8 %JAVA_PROPERTIES% %CLUSTER_PROPERTIES%

Next, you need to specify local environment settings to support Liferay's
memory requirements, its use of the [Apache Lucene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene) 
search engine library, and its use of Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) with
[AspectJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ).

From within the domain, open the script file that starts the server that will
host the Liferay application. To deploy Liferay to a managed server
(recommended) you'd edit the `startManagedWebLogic.[cmd|sh]` script file. If
you're on Windows, you'd add directives similar to those listed below, after the
`SETLOCAL` command:

    set "USER_MEM_ARGS=-Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=512m"
    
    set "MW_HOME=D:\Oracle\Middleware\wlserver"
    
    set "JAVA_OPTIONS=%JAVA_OPTIONS% -da:org.apache.lucene... -da:org.aspectj..."

Make sure to set your `MW_HOME` value to your WebLogic server's location. On
Linux, you'd make similar changes replacing `%JAVA_OPTIONS%` with
`$JAVA_OPTIONS`. 

Now that your WebLogic environment is configured for Liferay, you should
consider how you want to manage the database and mail session for Liferay. We
recommend that you use Liferay to manage your database and mail session. If you
want to use Liferay to manage them, you can skip the next sections and go to the
section that follows titled *Security Configuration*. But if for some reason
you'd rather configure your database and/or mail session within WebLogic, you
can start your WebLogic server and follow the instructions in the next
section(s) that apply. 

## Database Configuration [](id=database-configuration)

If you want WebLogic to manage your database for Liferay, use the following
procedure. If you want to use Liferay's built-in data source (recommended), you
can skip this section.

1.  Select *Services &rarr; Data Sources.* Click *New &rarr; Generic Data
    Source*.

2.  Give your data source a name, such as *Liferay Data Source*. The JNDI name
    should be `jdbc/LiferayPool`.

3.  Choose the type of database and click *Next*. 

4.  Click *Next* three times. You should be on the *Connection Properties*
    screen. Enter the database name, the host name, the port, the database user
    name, and the password. WebLogic uses this information to construct the
    appropriate JDBC URL to connect to your database. Click *Next*.

5.  WebLogic prompts you to confirm the information you've specified for your
    data source. 

    Depending on the database you're using, you may need to specify additional
    parameters. If you need to access previous wizard pages to modify
    information, click *Back* to revisit those pages. 

    When you're done specifying your configuration, click *Next*. 

6.  Click *Test Configuration* to make sure WebLogic can connect to your
    database successfully. When it does, click *Finish*.

7.  WebLogic shows the listing of data sources. Notice that your new data source
    has no value in the *Target* column. Click on your data source to edit it.

8.  Click the *Targets* tab and check off the server instance(s) to which you
    wish to deploy your data source. Then click *Save*.

9.  To configure additional portal properties for the WebLogic data source, you
    must shutdown the server(s) that you're targeting for the Liferay
    deployment. 

10. Create a `portal-ext.properties` file in your Liferay Home folder. 

11. Add the following property setting to your `portal-ext.properties` file.

        jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool

Your data source is set up in WebLogic Server. You'll need to configure a mail
session too. We recommend that you use Liferay to manage your portal's mail
session. If you want to use Liferay to manage your portal's mail session
(recommended), skip the next section. If for some reason you want to use
WebLogic to manage your mail session, you can follow the instructions in the
next section. 

## Mail Configuration [](id=mail-configuration)

If you want WebLogic to manage your mail session, use the following procedure.
If you want to use Liferay's built-in mail session (recommended), you can skip
this section. 

1.  Start your WebLogic server(s). 

2.  Select *Mail Sessions* and create a new mail session which points to your
    mail server.

3.  Give it the name *Liferay Mail* and give it the JNDI name of
    `mail/MailSession` and click *Next*.

4.  Choose your server and then click *Finish*.

5.  To configure additional portal properties for the WebLogic mail session,
    you must shutdown the server(s) that you're targeting for the Liferay
    deployment. 

6. Create a `portal-ext.properties` file in your Liferay Home folder, if you
    haven't already created it. 

7. Add the following property setting to your `portal-ext.properties` file.

        mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession

Liferay Portal will reference your WebLogic mail session via this portal
property setting. 

Before you deploy Liferay, regardless of whether you're using Liferay or
WebLogic to manage your database and/or mail session, you should enable and
configure Java Security. This will enable your portal to use Liferay's plugin
security manager with the Liferay apps that you download and install from
Liferay Marketplace. 

## Security Configuration [](id=security-configuration)

When you are ready to start using apps from Marketplace, you'll want to protect
your portal and your WebLogic server from security threats. To do so, you must
enable Java Security on your WebLogic server and specify a security policy to
grant Liferay Portal access to your server. 

First, you'll grant Liferay access to your server. This configuration opens all
permissions--you can fine-tune your policy's permissions later. Create a policy
file named `weblogic.policy` in your `$WL_HOME/server/lib` folder
and add the following contents:

    grant {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

To enable security on your WebLogic server and direct the server to your policy
file, open the `setDomainEnv.[cmd|sh]` file in your domain's folder. Then set
the `-Djava.security.manager` Java option and set the property
`-Djava.security.policy==` to the location of your `weblogic.policy` file. You
can specify both settings on the same line like this: 

    -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy==$WL_HOME/server/lib

The double equals sign tells the app server to use this policy file on top of
any existing security policies. 

For extensive information on Java SE Security Architecture see its specification
documents at
[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/spec/security-spec.doc.html).
Also, see section [*Understanding Plugin Security Management*](https://www.liferay.com/documentation/liferay-portal/6.2/development/-/ai/understanding-plugin-security-management-liferay-portal-6-2-dev-guide-11-en)
in the Developer's Guide to learn how to configure Liferay plugin access to
resources. 

Next you'll learn how to configure your WebLogic application server for JSF
applications. 

## JSF Configuration [](id=jsf-configuration)

If you'd like to deploy JSF applications on your WebLogic application server,
you'll need to complete a few extra steps in your configuration process. If you
do not plan on using JSF applications in your application server, you can skip
this section. This section assumes you're using JSF 2.1 portlets. 

Complete the first section to ensure JSF applications deploy successfully to
your WebLogic application server. 

### Configuration for Deploying JSF Portlets [](id=configuration-for-deploying-jsf-portlets)

1. To avoid a `ViewExpiredException` with Ajax, disable the Liferay Portal
`ETagFilter` by adding the following property in the `portal-ext.properties`
file: 

        com.liferay.portal.servlet.filters.etag.ETagFilter=false

    For more information on this exception, refer to
    [FACES-1591](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/FACES-1591).

2. You'll need to adjust your memory settings for your environment variables.
   For your memory settings to be permanently set, they need to be hard-coded in
   the `startWebLogic.sh` script. Just above the definition of your home domain,
   add the following lines:

        export MW_HOME=$HOME/Oracle/Middleware
        export USER_MEM_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

    Note that if you have many portlet WAR modules, you may need to increase
    memory. For example, the following lines reserves double the amount of
    memory: 

        export MW_HOME=$HOME/Oracle/Middleware
        export USER_MEM_ARGS="-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -XX:CompileThreshold=8000 -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

3. If you're running the JSR 329 Portlet Bridge TCK, you'll need to include the
   `trinidad-api.jar` dependency in the global classpath (in the `lib` folder). 

4. In order for JSF 2.1 portlets to deploy correctly in WebLogic, the
   `WEB-INF/weblogic.xml` descriptor must be configured to fine-tune how class
   loading takes place. For a working example, please refer to the
   [weblogic.xml](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-faces/blob/3.2.x/demos/bridge/jsf2-portlet/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic.xml)
   descriptor from a demo JSF portlet. 

5. Due to a deficiency in the XML parser that ships with WebLogic, it is
   necessary to include a custom [Apache Xerces](http://xerces.apache.org/)
   parser as a dependency. In order to include it in the proper position in
   the WebLogic classpath, the Xerces JARs are included in the Mojarra Shared
   Library. Therefore, it is necessary to add Xerces as a dependency in the
   portlet's WEB-INF/lib folder. For example: 

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>xerces</groupId>
                <artifactId>xercesImpl</artifactId>
                <version>2.11.0</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

6. If using ICEfaces, PrimeFaces, or RichFaces, all JARs related to these
   projects must exist in `WEB-INF/lib`. 

Next, you'll need to upgrade Mojarra for your WebLogic application server. 
 
### Upgrading Mojarra [](id=upgrading-mojarra)

Liferay Faces requires JSF 2.1.29-04. However, the version of Mojarra that comes
with WebLogic 12c is version 2.1.20. Therefore, it is necessary to upgrade
Mojarra in WebLogic by creating a new Shared Library WAR with the updated
dependencies. 

1. Make sure your `MW_HOME` environment variable is defined (completed in step 2
   of the previous section).
 
2. `cd` into `liferay-faces/support`

3. If you are on Weblogic 12.1.3, then run the following command to upgrade to
    the latest version of JSF:

        mvn -P weblogic,upgrade clean install

    If you are on a version of weblogic other than 12.1.3, you will need to
    specify the path to Mojarra's pom file as the value of the maven property:
    `weblogic.mojarra.pom`. For example, on Weblogic 12.1.2 you would run the
    following command:

        mvn -P weblogic,upgrade clean install -Dweblogic.mojarra.pom=$MW_HOME/wlserver/plugins/maven/com/oracle/weblogic/glassfish.jsf_1.0.0.0_2-1-20/12.1.2/glassfish.jsf_1.0.0.0_2-1-20.12.1.2.pom  

    Since the Mojarra API and Implementation JARs are present in the global
    classpath, `jsf-api.jar` and `jsf-impl.jar` must not be included in
    `WEB-INF/lib`. 

You've successfully upgraded your Mojarra version. If you're interested in
configuring CDI for your JSF portlets running on WebLogic 12c, you'll need to
configure a few more things. For more information on configuring CDI, visit the
[Configuring JSF Portlets to Use CDI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/contexts-and-dependency-injection-for-jsf-portlets#configuring-jsf-portlets-to-use-cdi)
section. 

Now it's the moment you've been waiting for: Liferay deployment! 

## Deploy Liferay [](id=deploy-liferay)

Although you can deploy Liferay on a WebLogic Admin Server, we recommend
deploying Liferay to a managed server. As a best practice, you should dedicate
the Admin Server to managing other servers that run your apps. By deploying to a
managed server, you'll be able to startup/shutdown Liferay more quickly and
you'll more easily be able to extend Liferay into a cluster configuration. 

Regardlesss of which server(s) you target to host Liferay in your WebLogic
server domain, here are steps for deploying Liferay: 

1.  Start your WebLogic server, if it's not already started.

2.  Go to *Deployments* and select the Liferay `.war` file from the file system,
    or click the *Upload Your File(s)* link to upload it and then click *Next*.

3.  Select *Install this deployment as an application* and click *Next*.

4.  Target the server (e.g., a managed server) on which to deploy Liferay. 

5.  If the default name is appropriate for your installation, keep it.
    Otherwise, give it a name of your choosing and click *Next*.

6.  Click *Finish*. After the deployment finishes, click *Save*.
    Liferay precompiles all the JSPs, and Liferay launches.

If you're using Liferay to manage your database, you can use
[Liferay's Setup Wizard](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-liferays-setup-wizard)
that Liferay Portal shows the first time that you go to the portal. 

If you're using Liferay to manage your mail session (recommended), you
can configure the mail session in the Control Panel. You go to *Control Panel
&rarr; Server Administration &rarr; Mail* and enter the settings for your mail
session. 

Congratulations! You're now running Liferay on Oracle WebLogic 12c.
