# Setting up Your LCS Account [](id=setting-up-your-lcs-account)

To use LCS, you just need to use your liferay.com user credentials. 
After you have loged in you're then taken to the *Projects* screen where you can join an existing 
project or create a new one.

The list of existing projects, if present, is the list of projects associated 
with the domain of your email address. This is typically the company your email 
address is associated with. For example, if your email address is 
`joebloggs@janesblogfactory.com`, you're then presented with a list of existing 
projects registered to users with the `@janesblogfactory.com` domain. This lets 
you quickly and easily join the LCS projects that are associated with your 
company. To request access to a project, simply check its checkbox and click 
*Save*. Your request is then sent to the project administrator for approval. 
Note that it's possible for the project administrator to pre-assign you a role 
in a project (more on LCS roles in a moment). In this case, you won't have to 
wait for approval. For more information on user management in LCS, please see 
the *Managing LCS Users in Your Project* section of this guide.

Alternatively, you can create a new project and make yourself its administrator. 
To do so, click the checkbox next to 
*Create a project and become an administrator* in the New Project section of the 
Projects screen. The section then expands to let you name the project and choose 
to go to directly to the project's *Dashboard* (more on the Dashboard later). 
Give your project a name and then click *Save*.

So what exactly can an LCS Administrator do? Fantastic question! As LCS 
Administrator, you can assign roles to the rest of the users in your project. 
Each user of LCS needs to have an assigned role. The following roles are 
available: 

- LCS Administrator: All LCS functionality is available to administrators. This 
  is the only role that can manage the roles of other users.
- LCS Environment Manager: All LCS functionality is available in the scope of 
  an environment, with the exception of managing other users.
- LCS Environment Viewer: Has read-only access in the scope of an environment.

Now that your LCS account has been set up and you have an understanding of the 
LCS roles, you can get your portal ready for LCS.
