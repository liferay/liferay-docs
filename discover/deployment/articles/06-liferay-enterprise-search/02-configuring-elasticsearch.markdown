# Configuring Elasticsearch for @product@ [](id=configuring-elasticsearch-for-liferay-0)

@product@ is an open source project, so you won't be surprised to learn that the
default search engine that ships with @product@ is also an open source project.
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine that
ships with @product@. 

By default, @product@ runs Elasticsearch as an embedded search engine, but it's
only supported in production locally or remotely, as a separate server or
cluster. This guide walks you through that process.

If you'd rather use Solr, it's also supported. See [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-solr) for information
on installing and configuring Solr.

If you just want to get up and running quickly with Elasticsearch, refer to the
[Configuring Search
article](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-search). It
assumes that you only want to know what's necessary for the installation and
configuration of Elasticsearch in a single server environment, and it doesn't
include all the clustering and tuning instructions found here.In this article
you'll learn how to configure Elasticsearch for use in @product@ production
environments. 

If you've come here looking for information on search engines in general, or the
low level search infrastructure of @product@, refer to the developer tutorial
[Introduction to Liferay Search](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/introduction-to-liferay-search).

These terms will be useful to understand as you read this guide:

-  *Elasticsearch Home* refers to the root folder of your unzipped Elasticsearch
   installation (for example, `elasticsearch-2.2.0`). 

-  *Liferay Home* refers to the root folder of your @product@ installation. It
   contains the `osgi`, `deploy`, `data`, and `license` folders, among others.

## Embedded vs. Remote Operation Mode [](id=embedded-vs-remote-operation-mode)

When you install @product@, there's an embedded Elasticsearch already installed.
In embedded mode, Elasticsearch search runs with @product@ as a library in the
same JVM. This is done by default to make it easy to test-drive @product@ with
minimal configuration. Running Elasticsearch and @product@ in the same process has
drawbacks:

-  Your Elasticsearch configuration uses the same JVM options as @product@.
-  @product@ and Elasticsearch compete for resources. 

You wouldn't run an embedded database like HSQL in production, and you shouldn't
run Elasticsearch in embedded mode in production either. Instead, you want your
@product@ installation to run alongside Elasticsearch. This is called *remote
operation mode*, as a standalone server or cluster of server nodes. The first
step is to install Elasticsearch.

## Installing Elasticsearch [](id=installing-elasticsearch)

Install Elasticsearch, and then you can begin configuring it to use with
@product@. 

1.  Follow the instructions
    [here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-elasticsearch#step-one-find-the-right-version-of-elasticsearch)
    to find the version of Elasticsearch that matches your installation and
    download it. 

2.  Extract the contents of the compressed file you downloaded to your Liferay
    Home folder. 

3.  Before continuing, make sure you have set the [`JAVA_HOME` environment
    variable](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/)

4.  If you have multiple JDKs installed, make sure Elasticsearch and @product@ are
    using the same version. You can specify this in `[Elasticsearch
    Home]/bin/elasticsearch.in.sh`:

        JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java

5.  Install the following required Elasticsearch plugins:

    -  `analysis-icu`
    -  `analysis-kuromoji`
    -  `analysis-smartcn`
    -  `analysis-stempel`

    To install these plugins, navigate to Elasticsearch Home and enter
    
        ./bin/plugin install [plugin-name]

    Replace *[plugin-name]* with the Elasticsearch plugin's name.

6.  Make the `[Elasticsearch_Home]/bin/elasticsearch.sh` file executable (if
    you're on Linux).

For more details refer to the [Elasticsearch installation guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/_installation.html)

Once you have Elasticsearch installed, you need to configure it for @product@.

## Configuring Elasticsearch [](id=configuring-elasticsearch)

For detailed Elasticsearch configuration information, refer to the
[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/setup-configuration.html#settings).

The name of your Elasticsearch cluster is important. When you're running
Elasticsearch in remote mode, the cluster name is used by @product@ to recognize
the Elasticsearch cluster. To learn about setting the Elasticsearch cluster name
on the @product@ side, refer below to the section called Configuring the Liferay
Elasticsearch adapter. 

Elasticsearch's configuration files are written in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org)
and kept in the `[Elasticsearch Home]/config` folder:

-  `elasticsearch.yml` is for configuring Elasticsearch modules
-  `logging.yml` is for configuring Elasticsearch logging

To set the name of the Elasticsearch cluster, open `[Elasticsearch
Home]/config/elasticsearch.yml` and specify

    cluster.name: LiferayElasticsearchCluster

Since `LiferayElasticsearchCluster` is the default name given to the cluster in
@product@, this would work just fine. Of course, you can name your cluster
whatever you'd like (we humbly submit the recommendation
`clustery_mcclusterface`).<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> You can configure your node name using the same
syntax (setting the `node.name` property).

If you'd rather work from the command line than in the configuration file,
navigate to Elasticsearch Home and enter

    ./bin/elasticsearch --cluster.name clustery_mcclusterface --node.name nody_mcnodeface

Feel free to change the node name or the cluster name. Once you configure
Elasticsearch to your liking, start it up.

## Starting Elasticsearch [](id=starting-elasticsearch)

Start Elasticsearch by navigating to Elasticsearch Home and typing 

    ./bin/elasticsearch

if you run Linux, or 

    \bin\elasticsearch.bat

if you run Windows.

To run as a daemon in the background, add the `-d` switch to either command:

    ./bin/elasticsearch -d

Now that you have Elasticsearch itself installed and running, and [@product@ installed](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-installation-overview)
and running (do that if you haven't already) you need to introduce @product@ and
Elasticsearch to each other. Fortunately, Liferay provides an adapter that helps
it find and integrate your Elasticsearch cluster.

## Configuring the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter [](id=configuring-the-liferay-elasticsearch-adapter)

@product@ has an Elasticsearch adapter that ships with @product@. It's a module
from the Liferay Foundation Suite that's deployed to the OSGi runtime, titled
*Liferay Portal Search Elasticsearch*. This adapter provides integration between
Elasticsearch and @product@. Before you configure the adapter, make sure
Elasticsearch is running. 

There are two ways to configure the adapter: 

1. Use the System Settings application in the Control Panel. 

2. Manually create an OSGi configuration file. 

It's convenient to configure the Elasticsearch adapter from System Settings, but
this is often only possible during development and testing. If you're not
familiar with System Settings, you can read about it
[here](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/system-settings). Even if you need
a configuration file so you can use the same configuration on another @product@
system, you can still use System Settings. Just make the configuration edits you
need, then export the `.config` file with your configuration.

Here are the steps to configure the Elasticsearch adapter from the System
Settings application:

1. Start @product@.
2. Navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*
   &rarr; *Foundation*. 
3. Find the *Elasticsearch* entry (scroll down and browse to it or use the
   search box) and click the Actions icon
   (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)), then *Edit*.

    ![Figure 1: Use the System Settings application in @product@'s Control Panel to
    configure the Elasticsearch
    adapter.](../../images/elasticsearch-system-settings.png)

4. Change Operation Mode to *Remote*, and then click *Save*.

    ![Figure 2: Set Operation Mode to *Remote* from System
    Settings.](../../images/elasticsearch-configuration.png)

5. After you switch operation modes (`EMBEDDED` &rarr; `REMOTE`), you must
   trigger a re-index. Navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Server
   Administration*, find the *Index Actions* section, and click *Execute* next
   to *Reindex all search indexes.* 

When preparing a system for production deployment, you want to set up a
repeatable deployment process. Therefore, it's best to use the OSGi
configuration file, where your configuration is maintained in a controlled
source.

Follow these steps to configure the Elasticsearch adapter using an OSGi
configuration file:

1. Create the following file:
    
        [Liferay_Home]/osgi/configs/com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config

2. Add this to the configuration file you just created:

        operationMode="REMOTE"
        # If running Elasticsearch from a different computer:
        #transportAddresses="ip.of.elasticsearch.node:9300"
        # Highly recommended for all non-prodcution usage (e.g., practice, tests, diagnostics):
        #logExceptionsOnly="false"

3. Start @product@ or re-index if @product@ is already running.

As you can see from the System Settings entry for Elasticsearch, there are a lot
more configuration options available that help you tune your system for optimal
performance. For a detailed accounting of these, refer to the reference article
on [Elasticsearch Settings](/discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/elastic-search-setttings).

What follows here are some known-good configurations for clustering
Elasticsearch. These, however, can't replace the manual process of tuning,
testing under load, and tuning again, so we encourage you to examine the
[settings](/discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/elasticsearch-settings) as
well as the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/setup-configuration.html#settings) 
and go through that process once you have a working configuration. 

## Configuring a Remote Elasticsearch Host [](id=configuring-a-remote-elasticsearch-host)

In production systems Elasticsearch and @product@ are installed on different
servers. To make @product@ aware of the Elasticsearch cluster, set

    transportAddresses=[IP address of Elasticsearch Node]:9300

in the Elasticsearch adapter's OSGi configuration file. List as many or as few
Elasticsearch nodes in this property as you'd like. This tells @product@ the IP
address or host name where search requests are to be sent. If using System
Settings, set the value in the *Transport Addresses* property.

+$$$

**Note:** In an Elasticsearch cluster you can list the transport addresses for
multiple Elasticsearch nodes, if appropriate. Just use a comma-separated list in
the `transportAddresses` property. If you set only one transport address,
@product@ loses contact with Elasticsearch if that node goes down.

$$$

On the Elasticsearch side, set the `network.host` property in your
`elaticsearch.yml` file. This property simultaneously sets both the *bind host*
(the host Elasticsearch listens on for requests) and the *publish host* (the
host name or IP address Elasticsearch uses to communicate with other nodes). See
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/modules-network.html)
for more information.

## Clustering Elasticsearch in Remote Operation Mode [](id=clustering-elasticsearch-in-remote-operation-mode)

Clustering Elasticsearch is easy. Each time you run the Elasticsearch start
script, a new node is added to the cluster. If you want four nodes, for example,
just run `./bin/elasticsearch` four times. If you only run the start script
once, you have a cluster with just one node.

Elasticsearch's default configuration works for a cluster of up to ten nodes,
since the default number of shards is `5`, while the default number of replica
shards is `1`:

    index.number_of_shards: 5
    index.number_of_replicas: 1

+$$$

**Note:** Elasticsearch uses the [Zen Discovery
Module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/modules-discovery-zen.html)
by default, which provides unicast discovery. Additionally, nodes in the
cluster communicate using the [Transport
Module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/modules-transport.html),
through TCP. See the Elasticsearch documentation for the available properties
(to be set in the elasticsearch.yml file), and the @product@ Elasticsearch
Adapter’s [reference
article](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/elasticsearch-settings)
for the adapter’s available settings.

At a minimum, provide the list of hosts to act as gossip routers during unicast
discovery in the `elasticsearch.yml`:

    discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["node1.ip.address", "node2.ip.address"]

$$$

For more information on configuring an Elasticsearch cluster, see the
documentation on [Elasticsearch Index Settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_index_settings.html).

## Advanced Configuration of the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter [](id=advanced-configuration-of-the-liferay-elasticsearch-adapter)

The default configurations for Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter module are set
in a Java class:

    com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration

While the Elasticsearch adapter has a lot of configuration options out of the
box, you might find an Elasticsearch configuration you need that isn't provided
by default. In this case, you can add the configuration options you need. If you
can configure something for Elasticsearch, you can configure it using the
Elasticsearch adapter in @product@.

### Adding Settings and Mappings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter [](id=adding-settings-and-mappings-to-the-liferay-elasticsearch-adapter)

@product@ has divided the [available configuration options](/discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/elasticsearch-setttings) 
into two groups: the ones you'll use most often by default, and a catch-all for
everything else. If you need to configure the local Elasticsearch client when
running in remote mode, but the necessary setting isn't available by default,
you can still configure it with the Liferay Elasticsearch adapter. Just specify
the settings you need by using one or more of the `additionalConfigurations`,
`additionalIndexConfigurations`, or `additionalTypeMappings` settings. 

![Figure 3: You can add Elasticsearch configurations to the ones currently available
in System Settings.](../../images/elasticsearch-additional-configs.png)

`additionalConfigurations` is used to define extra settings (defined in YAML)
for the embedded Elasticsearch or the local Elasticsearch client when running
in remote mode. In production, only one additional configuration can be added here: 

    client.transport.ping_timeout

The rest of the settings for the client are available as default configuration
options in the Liferay Elasticsearch adapter. See the [Elasticsearch
Settings](/discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/elasticsearch-setttings)
reference article for more information. See the [Elasticsearch
documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/2.2/transport-client.html)
for a description of all the client settings and for an example.

`additionalIndexConfigurations` is used to define extra settings (in JSON or
YAML format) that are applied to the @product@ index when it's created. For
example, you can create custom analyzers and filters using this setting. For
a complete list of available settings, see the [Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/index-modules.html).

Here's an example that shows how to configure [analysis](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/analysis-intro.html#analysis-intro) that can be applied to a
dynamic template (see below).

    {  
        "analysis": {
            "analyzer": {
                "kuromoji_liferay_custom": {
                    "filter": [
                        "cjk_width",
                        "kuromoji_baseform",
                        "pos_filter"
                    ],
                    "tokenizer": "kuromoji_tokenizer"
                }
            },
            "filter": {
                "pos_filter": {
                    "type": "kuromoji_part_of_speech"
                }
            }
        }
    }

`additionalTypeMappings` is used to define extra field mappings for the
`LiferayDocumentType` type definition, which are applied when the index is
created. Add these field mappings in using JSON syntax. For more information see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/mapping.html)
and
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/indices-put-mapping.html).
Use `additionalTypeMappings` for new field mappings, but do not try to override
existing `properties` mappings. If any of the `properties` mappings set here
overlap with existing mappings, index creation will fail. Use
`overrideTypeMappings` to replace the default `properties` mappings.

Here's an example of a [dynamic
template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/dynamic-templates.html)
that uses the analysis configuration above to analyze all string fields that end
with `_ja`.

    { 
        "LiferayDocumentType": {
            "dynamic_templates": [
                {
                    "template_ja": {
                        "mapping": {
                            "analyzer": "kuromoji_liferay_custom",
                            "index": "analyzed",
                            "store": "true",
                            "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
                            "type": "string"
                        },
                        "match": "\\w+_ja\\b|\\w+_ja_[A-Z]{2}\\b",
                        "match_mapping_type": "string",
                        "match_pattern": "regex"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

The above code adds a new `template_ja` dynamic template. This overrides the
existing dynamic template with the same name. As with dynamic templates, you can
add sub-field mappings to @product@'s type mapping. These are referred to as
[properties](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/properties.html)
in Elasticsearch.

    { 
        "LiferayDocumentType": {  
            "properties": {   
                "fooName": {
                    "index": "not_analyzed",
                    "store": "yes",
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }   
        }
    }

The above example shows how a `fooName` field might be added to @product@'s type
mapping. Because `fooName` is not an existing property in the mapping, it will
work just fine. If you try to override an existing property mapping, index
creation will fail. Instead use the `overrideTypeMappings` setting to override
`properties` in the mapping.

+$$$

**Note:** To see that your additional mappings have been added to the
`LiferayDocumentType`, navigate to this URL after saving your additions and
reindexing:

    http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

Here's what it would look like for an Elasticsearch instance running on
`localhost:9200`, with a @product@ Company ID of `20116`:

    http://localhost:9200/liferay-20116/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

In the above URL, `liferay-20116`is the index name. Including it indicates that
you want to see the mappings that were used to create the index with that name.

$$$

Use `overrideTypeMappings` to override @product@'s default type mappings. This
is an advanced feature that should be used only if strictly necessary. If you
set this value, the default mappings used to define the Liferay Document Type in
@product@ source code (for example, `liferay-type-mappings.json`) are ignored
entirely, so include the whole mappings definition in this property, not just
the segment you're modifying. To make a modification, find the entire list of
the current mappings being used to create the index by navigating to the URL

    http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

Copy the contents in as the value of this property (either into System Settings
or your OSGi configuration file). Leave the opening curly brace `{`, but delete
lines 2-4 entirely:

    "liferay-[COMPANY_ID]": {
        "mappings" : {
            "LiferayDocumentType" : {

Then, from the end of the mappings, delete the concluding three curly braces.

            }
        }
    }

Now modify whatever mappings you'd like. The changes take effect once you save
the changes and trigger a reindex from Server Administration. If you need to add
new custom mappings without overriding any defaults, use
`additionalTypeMappings` instead.

+$$$

**Note:** There's actually a third way to add configuration options to the
Elasticsearch adapter. You or your favorite developer can publish a Settings
Contributor Component and deploy it to Liferay's OSGi runtime. A developer
tutorial on Search Extension Points will be written for this. In summary, the
contributor module needs these things:

-  A class that implements either
`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.settings.SettingsContributor` or
`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.settings.IndexSettingsContributor`.
    -  If you're adding settings that would go into `additionalConfigurations`,
    override `SettingsContributor`. 
    -  If you want to add settings that would go into
    `additionalIndexConfigurations` or `additionalTypeMappings`, implement
    `IndexSettingsContributor`.
-  An OSGi `@Component` annotation for either of the implementations mentioned
    in the last step.

$$$

### Multi-line YAML Configurations [](id=multi-line-yaml-configurations)

If you configure the settings from the last section using an OSGi configuration
file, you might find yourself needing to write YML snippets that span multiple
lines. The syntax for that is straightforward and just requires appending each
line with `\n\`, like this:

    additionalConfigurations=\
                        cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false\n\
                        cluster.service.slow_task_logging_threshold: 600s\n\
                        index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn: 600s\n\
                        index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn: 600s\n\
                        index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn: 600s\n\
                        monitor.jvm.gc.old.warn: 600s\n\
                        monitor.jvm.gc.young.warn: 600s

## Troubleshooting Elasticsearch [](id=troubleshooting-elasticsearch)

Sometimes things don't go as planned. If you've set up @product@ with
Elasticsearch in remote mode, but @product@ can't connect to Elasticsearch, check
these things:

-  Cluster name: The value of the `cluster.name` property in Elasticsearch must
match the `clusterName` property you configured for Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter.

-  Transport address: The value of the `transportAddress` property in the
Elasticsearch adapter must match the port where Elasticsearch is running. If
@product@ is running in embedded mode, and you start a standalone Elasticsearch
node or cluster, it detects that port `9300` is taken and switches to port
`9301`. If you then set Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter to remote mode, it 
continues to look for Elasticsearch at the default port (`9300`).

Now that you have Elasticsearch configured for use with @product@, if you're a @product@
customer, you can read
[here](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/shield) to learn about
configuring Shield to secure your Elasticsearch data.
