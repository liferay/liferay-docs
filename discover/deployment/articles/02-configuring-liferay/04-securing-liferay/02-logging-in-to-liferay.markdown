# Logging in to Liferay [](id=logging-in-to-liferay)

One of the primary functions of a web portal is to restrict access to different
pages, content, and web applications. These kinds of portal resources should
only be accessible by the appropriate users. E.g., a student who logs in to a
university portal should not be able to access the same resources that are
available to a professor. Similarly, a patient who logs in to a health care
portal should not be able to access the same resources that are available to a
doctor. Some portal resources (at least a login page) should be available to
users who have not logged in. In @product@, users who have not logged in are
called *guest* users. <!-- To learn more about how Liferay restricts access to
portal resources to different users, please see the [Roles and Permissions]()
documentation. (Not yet written) -->

Liferay's Sign In portlet provides the basic means for users to log in to
Liferay. By default, users can also use the Sign In portlet to create new
accounts or to request a password reset. The home page of a default @product@
installation contains a Sign In portlet. You can access this page at
[http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home](http://localhost:8080/web/guest/home) if
you're running Liferay locally.

Even if the Sign In portlet has not been added to any Liferay page that's
accessible to a guest user, users can still access it by navigating to this
URL:

- [localhost:8080/c/portal/login](localhost:8080/c/portal/login)

Note that @product@'s configured authentication type determines the type of
credentials that the user needs to enter in order to log in. @product@ supports
three authentication types: authentication by email address, screen name, or
user ID. To choose an authentication type, navigate to the Control Panel, click
on *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings* &rarr; *Authentication* and use
the *How do users authenticate?* dropdown to make a selection. Alternatively,
add the following lines to your `portal-ext.properties` file, uncomment the
appropriate line, comment out the others, and restart your Liferay server.

    company.security.auth.type=emailAddress
    #company.security.auth.type=screenName
    #company.security.auth.type=userId

Liferay's default authentication type uses users' email addresses. Users'
screen names or user IDs can be used instead. Screen names are chosen when a
new account is created either by the user or by an administrator. User IDs are
autogenerated by Liferay. Regardless of which authentication type is
configured, users must always enter a password to log in to @product@. <!-- For
information on adding restrictions on the kinds of passwords that are allowed
or required (e.g., to require a minimum password length or require special
characters), please see the [Password Policies]() documentation. -->

By default, guest users can create accounts on your portal by clicking on the
*Create Account* link in the Sign In portlet, completing the form, and
submitting it. If a user already has an account but has forgotten its password,
the user can click on the *Forgot Password* link to request a password reset.
Both the *Create Account* form and the *Forgot Password* form include a
CAPTCHA-based text verification field. Using [CAPTCHA](http://www.captcha.net)
prevents bots from submitting these forms. @product@ can be configured to use
[reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) instead of
CAPTCHA. One advantage of using reCAPTCHA is that it can allow visually
impaired users to pass the test. To configure Liferay to use reCAPTCHA,
navigate to the Control Panel, then click on *System* &rarr; *Server
Administration* &rarr; *CAPTCHA*.

The security requirements of some web portals require that all user accounts be
created by administrators. @product@ supports this use case by allowing the
*Create Account* to be removed. To prevent guest users from creating new user
accounts, navigate to the Control Panel, click on *Configuration* &rarr;
*Instance Settings* &rarr; *Authentication* and uncheck the *Allow strangers to
create accounts?* box. You can also disallow users from requesting forgotten
passwords or from requesting password reset links by unchecking the appropriate
boxes. <!-- For further information about Liferay's authentication options,
please see this [documentation]() (not yet written). -->

Remember that using the Sign In portlet provides the most basic way for users
to log in to @product@ but it's not the only way. @product@ allows user accounts to
be imported from and exported to LDAP directories. @product@ can be configured to
use single-sign-on (SSO) solutions. Liferay supports token-based
authentication. This mechanism allows remote web applications to authenticate
to Liferay. Please refer to the other articles in this section for more
information. Finally, remember that @product@'s user authentication and remote
application authentication mechanisms are extensible. <!-- Please see Liferay's
[security documentation]() (not yet written) for developers for further
information. -->
