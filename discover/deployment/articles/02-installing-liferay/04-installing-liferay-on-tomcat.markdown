# Installing @product@ on Tomcat 8 [](id=installing-liferay-on-tomcat-8)

Liferay Digital Enterprise 7.0 bundled with Tomcat is available on 
[Customer Portal](https://web.liferay.com/group/customer/dxp/downloads/digital-enterprise). 
Even if you want to install @product@ manually on an existing Tomcat 8
application server, it can be helpful to download a @product@ Tomcat bundle. The
bundle contains many required dependencies and configuration files. Before
proceeding, you should also [download](https://web.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases#additional-versions)
the latest @product@ WAR file as well as the dependencies ZIP file and OSGi JARs
ZIP file.

Installing @product@ manually requires these basic steps:

- Installing @product@ dependencies to your application server
- Configuring your application server for @product@
- Installing the @product@ WAR file to your application server

You'll see the term
[*Liferay Home*](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/installing-product#liferay-home)
used in this installation guide. *Liferay Home* refers to the folder containing
your Tomcat server folder. When @product@ is installed on Tomcat, the Liferay
Home folder contains the Tomcat server folder as well as `data`, `deploy`,
`license`, and `osgi` folders. You'll also see the term `$TOMCAT_HOME` used in
this guide. `$TOMCAT_HOME` refers to your Tomcat server folder. This folder is
usually named `tomcat-[version]` or `apache-tomcat-[version]`.

## Installing @product@ Dependencies [](id=installing-liferay-dependencies)

@product@ depends on many JARs that are included in the @product@ Tomcat bundle.
Some JARs in the bundle are not strictly required but can still be useful. If
you don't have a @product@ Tomcat bundle, you can download the required JARs from
third-parties, as described below.

1. If you downloaded a @product@ Tomcat bundle, extract the bundle to a temporary
   location of your choosing. You'll copy a number of resources from this
   bundle to your Tomcat server as you manually install @product@.

2. If you have a @product@ Tomcat bundle, copy all the JARs from your bundle's
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder to your application server's
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder. If the `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder doesn't
   exist on your application server, create it. If you don't have a @product@
   Tomcat bundle, you'll have to individually download the JARs listed below.

    Here's a list of the JARs that you need to copy or download to your
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder:

    - `activation.jar` - [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jaf11-139815.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jaf11-139815.html)
    - `ccpp.jar` - [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ccpp/ccpp/1.0](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ccpp/ccpp/1.0)
    - `com.liferay.osgi.service.tracker.collections.jar` - [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay/com.liferay.osgi.service.tracker.collections](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay/com.liferay.osgi.service.tracker.collections)
    - `com.liferay.registry.api.jar` - [https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/repositories/liferay-public-releases/com/liferay/com.liferay.registry.api](https://repository.liferay.com/nexus/content/repositories/liferay-public-releases/com/liferay/com.liferay.registry.api)
    - `hsql.jar` - [http://hsqldb.org/doc/src/org/hsqldb/jdbc/JDBCDriver.html](http://hsqldb.org/doc/src/org/hsqldb/jdbc/JDBCDriver.html)
    - `jms.jar`- [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html)
    - `jta.jar`- [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jta/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jta/index.html)
    - `jutf7.jar` - [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jutf7](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jutf7)
    - `mail.jar` - [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138643.html)
    - `mysql.jar` - [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j)
    - `persistence.jar`- [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)
    - `portal-kernel.jar` - [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.portal.kernel](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.liferay.portal/com.liferay.portal.kernel)
    - `portlet.jar` - [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.portlet/portlet-api](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.portlet/portlet-api)
    - `postgresql.jar` - [https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)
    - `support-tomcat.jar` - [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/liferay/portal/support-tomcat](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/liferay/portal/support-tomcat)

3. Make sure that Tomcat can access the JDBC driver for your database. The list
   of JARs above includes `mysql.jar` and `postgresql.jar`. If you're using a
   database whose JDBC driver is not included in the list above, download the
   driver and copy it to your `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder.

4. Create an `osgi` folder in your Liferay Home folder. Then extract the OSGi
   ZIP file that you downloaded into the `osgi` folder.

    @product@ requires an OSGi runtime, and the `osgi` folder provides this with
    many required JAR files and configuration files.

Checkpoint:

1. You should have the following files in the `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` folder:

- `activation.jar` 
- `ccpp.jar` 
- `com.liferay.osgi.service.tracker.collections.jar` 
- `com.liferay.registry.api.jar` 
- `hsql.jar` 
- `jms.jar`
- `jta.jar`
- `jutf7.jar`
- `mail.jar` 
- `mysql.jar`
- `persistence.jar`
- `portal-kernel.jar` 
- `portlet.jar` 
- `postgresql.jar`
- `support-tomcat.jar` 

2. The `osgi` folder has the following subfolders:

- `configs`
- `core`
- `marketplace`
- `target-platform`
- `test`

## Tomcat Configuration [](id=tomcat-configuration)

Next, you need to configure Tomcat for running @product@.

1. If you're working with a bundle, copy the `setenv.bat` and `setenv.sh` files
   from your bundle to your `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin` folder. If not, create these
   files. 

   These files set a number of JVM options for Catalina, which is Tomcat's
   servlet container. Among these options is the location of the Java runtime
   environment. If this environment is not available on your server globally,
   you must set its location in this file so Tomcat can run. Do this by pointing
   the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable for your OS to the location of the
   @product@ supported JRE:

        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-jdk
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

   Once you've done this, configure Catalina's options to support @product@: 

        CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true  -Dorg.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.ENABLE_CLEAR_REFERENCES=false -Duser.timezone=GMT -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=384m" 

   This sets the file encoding to UTF-8, prefers an IPv4 stack over IPv6,
   prevents Tomcat from working around garbage collection bugs relating to
   static or final fields (these bugs don't exist in @product@ and working
   around them causes problems with the logging system), sets the time zone to
   GMT, and gives the JVM 1GB of RAM. 

   These are initial settings. After installation you should tune your system
   for performance. As a result of that process, you may find you want to change
   particularly the amount of RAM available to @product@ based on how your
   system runs. 

2. If you're working with a bundle, copy the
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml` file from your bundle to the
   corresponding location in your application server. If not, create this file.
   The `ROOT.xml` file creates a web application context for @product@.
   `ROOT.xml` looks like this:

        <Context path="" crossContext="true">

            <!-- JAAS -->

            <!--<Realm
                className="org.apache.catalina.realm.JAASRealm"
                appName="PortalRealm"
                userClassNames="com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.jaas.PortalPrincipal"
                roleClassNames="com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.jaas.PortalRole"
            />-->

            <!--
            Uncomment the following to disable persistent sessions across reboots.
            -->

            <!--<Manager pathname="" />-->

            <!--
            Uncomment the following to not use sessions. See the property
            "session.disabled" in portal.properties.
            -->

            <!--<Manager className="com.liferay.support.tomcat.session.SessionLessManagerBase" />-->
        </Context>

    Setting `crossContext="true"` allows multiple web applications to use the
    same class loader. The configuration above includes commented instructions
    and tags for configuring a JAAS realm, disabling persistent sessions, and
    disabling sessions entirely.

3. Next, you should make sure that the libraries you copied to
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` are loaded when you start your server. If you're
   working with a bundle, copy the `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.properties` file
   from your bundle to your server. If not, open
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.properties` and replace the line

        common.loader=${catalina.base}/lib,${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar,${catalina.home}/lib,${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar

    with this one:

        common.loader="${catalina.base}/lib","${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib","${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/global","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/global/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib/ext","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/*.jar"

    This allows Catalina to access the JARs that you copied to
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext`.
common.loader="${catalina.base}/lib","${catalina.base}/lib/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib","${catalina.home}/lib/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/global","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/global/*.jar","${catalina.home}/lib/ext","${catalina.home}/lib/ext/*.jar"
4. If you're working with a bundle, copy the
   `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.policy` file from your bundle to your server. If
   not, just replace the contents of the `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.policy`
   file with this:

        grant {
            permission java.security.AllPermission;
        };

    If you want to enable PACL for @product@, you have to enable Tomcat's
    security manager and instruct Catalina to use the
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.policy` file. See the Enabling PACL section for
    more information.

5. Next, you should make sure that UTF-8 URI encoding is used consistently. If
   you're working with a bundle, copy the `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml` file
   to your server. If not, you can simply make a few edits to `server.xml`.
   Edit your `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml` file and add the attribute
   `URIEncoding="UTF-8"` wherever you see `redirectPort=8443`, in the
   definition of your connectors (HTTP and AJP). For example:

        <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />

    should become

        <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8" />

    And

        <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" />

    should become

        <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8" />

6. If you're on Unix, Linux, or Mac OS, navigate to your `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin`
   folder and run the following command

        chmod a+x *.sh

    This command makes the shell scripts in Tomcat's `bin` folder executable.

Checkpoint:

At this point, you've finished configuring the application server's JVM 
settings.

1.  The file encoding, user time-zone, preferred protocol stack have been set in 
    the `setenv.sh` (`setenv.bat` for Windows).

2.  The default amount of memory available has been increased.

3.  The web application context has been declared in 
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml`.

4.  The `common.loader` property which allows Catalina to access the JARs in
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ext` has been updated in
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.properties`.

5.  All Java permissions have been granted in the 
    `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.policy` file.

6.  UTF-8 encoding has been set in `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml`.

7.  If in a Unix/Linux environment, the `chmod a+x *.sh` command has been run to
    the shell scripts in Tomcat's `bin` folder executable.


## Tomcat Database Configuration [](id=tomcat-database-configuration)

The easiest way to handle your database configuration is to let @product@ manage
your data source. If you want to use @product@'s built-in data source, you can
skip this section. When you first @product@, you can enter the required database
configuration information on the Basic Configuration page.

If you want Tomcat to manage your data source, use this procedure:

1. Make sure your database server is installed and working. If it's installed
   on a different machine, make sure it's accessible from your @product@ machine.

2. Add your data source as a resource in the context of your web application
   specified in `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml`:

        <Context...>
            <Resource
                name="jdbc/LiferayPool"
                auth="Container"
                type="javax.sql.DataSource"
                driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
                url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/lportal?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8"
                username="root"
                password="root"
                maxActive="100"
                maxIdle="30"
                maxWait="10000"
            />
        </Context>

Note that the above resource definition assumes your database name is
*lportal*, that you're using MySQL, and that your MySQL username and password
are both *root*. You'll have to update these values with your own database name
and credentials.

Your Tomcat managed data source is now configured. Next, let's consider your
mail session.

## Tomcat Mail Configuration [](id=tomcat-mail-configuration)

As with database configuration, the easiest way to handle mail configuration is
to let @product@ handle your mail session. If you want to use @product@'s built-in
mail session, skip this section and use @product@'s Control Panel to configure a
mail server after @product@ has been installed and started.

If you want to manage your mail session with Tomcat, use these instructions:

To create a mail session bound to `mail/MailSession`, edit `$TOMCAT_
HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml` and configure your mail session. Make
sure to replace the example mail session values with your own.

    <Context...>
        <Resource
            name="mail/MailSession"
            auth="Container"
            type="javax.mail.Session"
            mail.pop3.host="pop.gmail.com"
            mail.pop3.port="110"
            mail.smtp.host="smtp.gmail.com"
            mail.smtp.port="465"
            mail.smtp.user="user"
            mail.smtp.password="password"
            mail.smtp.auth="true"
            mail.smtp.starttls.enable="true"
            mail.smtp.socketFactory.class="javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory"
            mail.imap.host="imap.gmail.com"
            mail.imap.port="993"
            mail.transport.protocol="smtp"
            mail.store.protocol="imap"
        />
    </Context>

Your mail session is configured. Next, you'll make sure @product@ can 
access your mail session and database.

## Configuring Tomcat-managed Database and Mail Sessions [](id=configuring-tomcat-managed-database-and-mail-sessions)

In this section, you'll specify appropriate properties for connecting to your
database and mail session.

1. If you will use *@product@* to manage your data source, simply follow
   the instructions on the Basic Configuration page that appears when you first
   start @product@.

    If you are using *Tomcat* to manage your data source, add the following
    line to your `portal-ext.properties` file in your *Liferay Home* folder to
    specify your data source:

        jdbc.default.jndi.name=jdbc/LiferayPool

2. If you will use *@product@* to manage your mail session, you can
   configure the mail session once @product@ has started. That is, after starting
   your portal as described in the *Deploying @product@* section, go to *Control
   Panel &rarr; Server Administration &rarr; Mail* and enter the information
   required to configure your mail session.

    If you are using *Tomcat* to manage your mail session, add the following
    configuration to your `portal-ext.properties` file to reference that mail
    session:

        mail.session.jndi.name=mail/MailSession

It's just that easy! Before you deploy @product@, you should configure
Portal Access Control Language (PACL) with @product@ on Tomcat.

## Enabling PACL [](id=enabling-pacl)

To enable PACL, you need to enable Tomcat's security manager. In the Tomcat
Configuration section above, you already added the required permissions to the
Tomcat policy configuration file, `catalina.policy`.

- Edit your `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/setenv.sh` (if on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS) or
  `setenv.bat` (if on Windows) and enable the security manager by inserting the
  following code into the `CATALINA_OPTS` variable (inside the quotation
  marks):

    `-Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=$CATALINA_BASE/conf/catalina.policy`

- Check that your `$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/catalina.policy` file specifies the
  required permissions (you should have already addressed this in the
  Configuring Tomcat section):

        grant {
            permission java.security.AllPermission;
        };

To enable the security manager on Tomcat, the server must be started with the
`-security` command line option. Shut down your Tomcat instance and then
restart it with the following command:

    ./startup.sh -security

Tomcat reports the message `Using Security Manager` to your terminal.

Now you have PACL enabled and configured for your portal.

## Adding Mojarra [](id=adding-mojarra)

If you'd like to use JSF applications in your Tomcat application server, you'll
need to add Mojarra. If you do not plan on using JSF applications in your
application server, you can skip this section.

The typical binary ZIP version of Tomcat does not contain any JSF runtime JARs
like Mojarra or MyFaces. This is because Tomcat is not a Java EE Application
Server like Oracle GlassFish, Oracle WebLogic, JBoss AS, or IBM WebSphere.
Also, Tomcat is not a Java EE Web Profile Server like Apache TomEE or Caucho
Resin.

There are two ways to approach using Mojarra with Tomcat: upgrading Tomcat's
context classpath or upgrading Tomcat's global classpath. Both methods require
adding/editing two JARs, which can be downloaded below:

- [`jsf-api`](https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/faces/jsf-api/2.1.29-08/)
- [`jsf-impl`](https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/com/sun/faces/jsf-impl/2.1.29-08/)

The typical approach for using Mojarra with Tomcat is to include `jsf-api.jar`
and `jsf-impl.jar` in the `WEB-INF/lib` folder in each JSF project. You can do
this by specifying the `jsf-api` and `jsf-impl` artifacts without a scope, or
with the scope set as `compile` (the default) in each JSF project:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
        <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.29-08</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
        <artifactId>jsf-impl</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.29-08</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>

Although it is possible to install Mojarra in the Tomcat global classpath, it
will not work properly without some small modifications to the `jsf-impl.jar`
dependency. The problem stems from the fact that the Mojarra
[`ConfigureListener`](https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/blob/2.1.29-08/jsf-ri/src/main/java/com/sun/faces/config/ConfigureListener.java)
class is automatically registered for all contexts under `tomcat/webapps`
because it is specified as a `<listener>` in the
[META-INF/jsf-jsf_core.tld](https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/blob/2.1.29-08/jsf-ri/conf/share/jsf_core.tld)
descriptor inside the `jsf-impl.jar` dependency.
Additionally, the
[META-INF/services/javax.faces.ServletContainerInitializer](https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/blob/2.1.29-08/jsf-ri/conf/share/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer)
will cause the
[FacesInitializer](https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/blob/2.1.29-08/jsf-ri/src/main/java/com/sun/faces/config/FacesInitializer.java)
class to auto-register the `ConfigureListener` as well. Consequently, every
request issued in all contexts invokes the Mojarra `ConfigureListener`. This
can be a potential performance problem in a webapp environment and causes
incompatibilities with a portlet environment. Therefore, it is necessary to
disable automatic registration of the Mojarra `ConfigureListener` by modifying
the contents of the `jsf-impl.jar` dependency.

To upgrade Tomcat's global classpath, follow the steps below:

1. Copy `jsf-api.jar` and `jsf-impl.jar` to the `tomcat/lib` folder.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `tomcat/lib` folder:

        cd tomcat/lib

3. Create a temporary folder named `jsf-impl` and navigate into it:

        mkdir jsf-impl
        cd jsf-impl

4. Extract the Mojarra `jsf-impl.jar` dependency into the temporary folder:

        jar xf ../jsf-impl-2.1.29-08.jar

        5. Open the `META-INF/jsf_core.tld` file and remove the following lines:

        <listener>
            <listener-class>com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener</listener-class>
        </listener>

6. Remove the Mojarra servlet container initializer:

        rm META-INF/services/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer

7. Overwrite the Mojarra `jsf-impl.jar` dependency by creating a new archive:

        jar cf ../jsf-impl-2.1.29-08.jar META-INF/ com/

8. Remove the temporary folder:

        cd ../
        rm -rf jsf-impl/

9. Follow only *one* of the following sub-steps below, depending on preference.

    9.1 Specify the `liferay-faces-init.jar` dependency in each JSF project in
    order for the Mojarra `ConfigureListener` to be automatically started by
    Tomcat:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.liferay.faces</groupId>
            <artifactId>liferay-faces-init</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.4-ga5</version>
        </dependency>

    9.2 Specify the Mojarra `ConfigureListener` as a listener in the
    `WEB-INF/web.xml` descriptor in each JSF project:

        <listener>
            <listener-class>com.sun.faces.config.ConfigureListener</listener-class>
        </listener>

10. Specify the `jsf-api` and `jsf-impl` dependencies as provided in each JSF
   project:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>
            <artifactId>jsf-api</artifactId>
            <version>2.1.29-08</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.faces</groupId>

You've officially added Mojarra to your application server.

If you're interested in configuring CDI for your JSF portlets running on Tomcat,
you'll also need to configure Weld. For more information on configuring Weld for
Tomcat, visit the
[Configuring JSF Portlets to Use CDI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/contexts-and-dependency-injection-for-jsf-portlets#configuring-jsf-portlets-to-use-cdi)
section.

Checkpoint

The previous sections contained optional settings where Tomcat manages your 
database and mail configurations. If you are using Mojarra with Tomcat, the 
`jsf-impl.jar` has been configured so that Mojarra is installed in the Tomcat 
global classpath.

## Deploying @product@ [](id=deploying-liferay)

Now you're ready to deploy @product@ using your @product@ WAR file.

1. If you are manually installing @product@ on a clean Tomcat server, delete the
   contents of the `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT` directory. This removes the default
   Tomcat home page.

2. Extract the @product@ `.war` file to `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT`.

    Now it's time to launch @product@ on Tomcat!

3. Start Tomcat by navigating to `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin` and executing `./startup.sh`
   or `startup.bat`. Alternatively, you can use `./catalina.sh run` or
   `catalina.bat run`. Using one of the latter commands makes your terminal or
   command prompt tail @product@'s log file. This can be useful if you want to
   see the startup activities performed by @product@.

Congratulations on successfully installing and deploying @product@ on Tomcat!
