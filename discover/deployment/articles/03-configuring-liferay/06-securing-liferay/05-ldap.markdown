# LDAP [](id=ldap)

@product@ fully supports LDAP as a user store. Use the LDAP tab in Instance
Settings's Authentication page to connect @product@ to an LDAP directory. Users
can be imported into @product@ from LDAP or exported to LDAP from @product@. If your
organization already stores user information on an LDAP server, it's convenient
for both users and administrators to simply have the LDAP user information
imported into @product@. Importing LDAP user information to @product@ means that
users don't have to remember an extra set of credentials for @product@.  Importing
LDAP user information to @product@ also means that administrators don't have to
create a whole new set of user accounts for @product@. In this article, you'll
learn how to connect @product@ to an LDAP server and how to configure import
settings, export settings, and related LDAP configuration settings. 

## Configuring @product@'s LDAP Settings [](id=configuring-liferays-ldap-settings)

To access @product@'s LDAP configuration settings, navigate to *Control Panel
&rarr; Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, then scroll down and expand the
form's *Authentication* section.  Go to the *LDAP* tab. Use this form to connect
@product@ to an LDAP directory.

You configure the global values from the LDAP tab of the Authentication page.

**Enabled:** Check this box to enable LDAP Authentication.

**Required:** Check this box if LDAP authentication is required. @product@ then
won't allow a user to log in unless he or she can successfully bind to the LDAP
directory first. Uncheck this box if users with @product@ accounts but no LDAP
accounts can log in to @product@.

**LDAP Servers:** @product@ supports connections to multiple LDAP servers. Use
the Add button beneath this heading to add LDAP servers. Each LDAP server has
the following configuration options:

**Import/Export:** You can import and export user data from LDAP directories
using the following options:

- *Enable Import:* Checking this box to cause @product@ to do a mass import
  from your LDAP directories. Leave this unchecked to keep the default behavior,
  which synchronizes users only when they log in. Definitely leave this
  unchecked if you are working in a clustered environment. Otherwise, all of
  your nodes would try to do a mass import when each of them starts up.

- *Enable Export:* Check this box to enable @product@ to export user accounts
  from its database to LDAP. @product@ uses a listener to track any changes made
  to the `User` object. @product@ pushes updates out to the LDAP server whenever
  a `User` object is modified. Note that by default on every login, fields such
  as `lastLoginDate` are updated. When export is enabled, this has the effect
  of causing a user export every time the user logs in. You can prevent updates
  to users' `lastLoginDate` fields from triggering LDAP user exports by setting
  the following property in your `portal-ext.properties` file:

        users.update.last.login=false

- *Enable Import on Startup:* Checking this box instructs @product@ to run the
  LDAP user import when it starts up. Note: This box only appears if you check
  the *Enable Import* box described above.

**Use LDAP Password Policy:** @product@ uses its own password policy by default.
This can be configured on the Control Panel's Password Policies page. Check the
*Use LDAP Password Policy* box if you want to use the password policies defined
by your LDAP directory. Once this is enabled, the Password Policies tab states
that you are not using a local password policy. You must now use your LDAP
directory's mechanism for setting password policies. @product@ cannot enforce
these policies; the best it can do is pass through the messages returned by your
LDAP server. It does this by parsing the messages in the LDAP controls the
server returns. By default, @product@ is configured to parse the messages
returned by the Fedora Directory Server. If you use a different LDAP server, you
must customize the messages in *System Settings &rarr; Foundation &rarr; System
LDAP Configuration*. 

Once you've finished configuring LDAP, click the *Save* button. 

### LDAP Options Available in System Settings [](id=ldap-options-available-in-system-settings)

Although most LDAP configuration can be done from Instance Settings, there are
several configuration parameters that are only available in System Settings. In
previous versions of @product@, system scoped settings for LDAP were [set in the
`portal.properties`
file](https://docs.liferay.com/portal/6.2/propertiesdoc/portal.properties.html#LDAP)
and modified using a `portal-ext.properties` file. Those settings must now be
made via System Settings.

If you need to change any of these options, navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr;
*Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*. Go to the *Foundation* section and
find the entries with LDAP in the title.

- On the *LDAP Auth* page, you can set the authentication method and the password
encryption algorithm. The Bind authentication method is preferred by
most vendors so you don't have to worry about encryption strategies. Password
compare does exactly what it sounds like: it reads the user's password out of
LDAP, decrypts it and compares it with the user's password in @product@, syncing
the two. If you use password compare, you can also choose the encryption
algorithm to use for the comparison.

- On the *LDAP Import* page, you can configure import
settings from LDAP. One example is the import methods. If you set this to User,
@product@ imports all users from the specified portion of the LDAP tree. If you
set this to Group, @product@ searches all the groups and imports the users in each
group. If you have users who do not belong to any groups, they are not imported.
 
- Use the *System LDAP Configuration* entry to manage error properties
like *Error password age keywords* which lets you set a list of phrases from
error messages which can possibly be returned by the LDAP server. When a user
binds to LDAP, the server returns *controls* with its response of success or
failure. These controls contain a message describing the error or the
information that is returned with the response. Though the controls are the same
across LDAP servers, the messages can be different. The properties described
here contain snippets of words from those messages and work with Red Hat's
Fedora Directory Server. If you are not using that server, the word snippets may
not work with your LDAP server. If they don't, you can replace the values of
these properties with phrases from your server's error messages. This enables
@product@ to recognize them.

**Note**: When you make a change in System Settings, it takes effect for the
virtual instance you're in. If after changing a setting you create a new
virtual instance, that virtual instance inherits the settings of the one it was
created from as defaults. For example, say you have virtual instances named A,
B, and C. From A, you modify *Error password history keywords*. This change
appears only in A, not in B or C. Then from A, you create virtual instance D.
The change to *Error password history keywords* appears in D (not B or C),
since D defaults to A's settings because you created it from A.

In summary, if there's a configuration you need to set up @product@ with LDAP, and
you don't find it in Instance Settings, look in the LDAP System Settings
entries.

### Adding LDAP Servers [](id=adding-ldap-servers)

Click on the *Add* button beneath the LDAP Servers heading to add an LDAP
server connection. If you have more than one LDAP server, you can arrange the
servers by order of preference using the up/down arrows. When you add an LDAP
Server, you must provide several pieces of data so @product@ can bind to that
LDAP server and search it for user records. Regardless of how many LDAP servers
you add, each server has the same configuration options.

**Server Name:** Enter a name for your LDAP server.

**Default Values:** Several leading directory servers are listed here. If you
are using one of these, select it and click the *Reset Values* button. The rest
of the form will be populated with the proper default values for that
directory.

**Connection:** These settings cover the basic connection to LDAP.

- *Base Provider URL:* The link to the LDAP server. Make sure the @product@ server
  can communicate with the LDAP server. If there is a firewall between the two
  systems, check to make sure the appropriate ports are opened.

- *Base DN:* The Base Distinguished Name for your LDAP directory. It is
  usually modeled after your organization. For a commercial organization, it may
  look similar to this: `dc=companynamehere,dc=com`.

- *Principal:* By default, the LDAP administrator user ID is populated here. If
  you have removed the default LDAP administrator, you will need to use the
  fully qualified name of the administrative credential that you use instead.
  You need an administrative credential because @product@ uses this ID to
  synchronize user accounts to and from LDAP.

- *Credentials:* This is the password for the LDAP administrative user.

This is all you need to make a regular connection to an LDAP directory. The rest
of the configuration is optional. The default attribute mappings usually provide
enough data to synchronize back to the @product@ database when a user attempts to
log in. To test the connection to your LDAP server, click the *Test LDAP
Connection* button.

#### Checkpoint [](id=checkpoint)

Before proceeding to fine tune @product@'s LDAP connections, ensure the
following steps have been taken:

1.  The LDAP connection has been enabled in the _Control Panel_. Depending on
    your needs, LDAP authentication may be required so that only users who have been
    bound may log in.

2.  *Export/Import*: for users in a clustered environment, this should be
    disabled so that there are no massive imports on every node upon start up. 

3.  When adding the LDAP server, the *Server Name*, *Default Values*,
    *Connection* values are correct. It is always a good idea to click the *Test
    LDAP Connection* before saving.

### Security [](id=security)

If you are running your LDAP directory in SSL mode to prevent credential
information from passing through the network unencrypted, you must perform extra
steps to share the encryption key and certificate between the two systems.

For example, if your LDAP directory is Microsoft Active Directory on
Windows Server 2003, you'd share the certificate like this:

Click *Start* &rarr; *Administrative Tools* &rarr; *Certificate Authority*.
Highlight the machine that is the certificate authority, right-click on it, and
click *Properties*. From the General menu, click *View Certificate*. Select the
Details view, and click *Copy To File*. Use the resulting wizard to save the
certificate as a file. You will also need to import the certificate into the
*cacerts keystore*. The import is handled by a command like the following:

    keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore /some/path/jdk1.5.0_11/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -alias MyRootCA -file /some/path/MyRootCA.cer

The *keytool* utility ships as part of the Java SDK.

Once this is done, go back to the LDAP page in the Control Panel. Modify the
LDAP URL in the Base DN field to the secure version by changing the protocol to
`ldaps` and the port to `636` like this:

    ldaps://myLdapServerHostname:636

Save the changes. Your @product@ now encrypts its authentication to LDAP.

## Managing LDAP Server [](id=managing-ldap-server)

**Users:** This section contains settings for finding users in your LDAP
directory.

- *Authentication Search Filter:* The search filter box can be used to determine
  the search criteria for user logins. By default, @product@ uses users' email
  addresses for their login names. If you have changed this setting, you must
  modify the search filter here, which has been configured to use the email
  address attribute from LDAP as a search criterion. For example, if you changed
  @product@'s authentication method to use screen names instead of the email
  addresses, you would modify the search filter so it can match the entered log
  in name:

        (cn=@screen_name@)

- *Import Search Filter:* Depending on the **LDAP** server, there are different
  ways to identify the user. The default setting is usually fine:

        (objectClass=inetOrgPerson)

    If you want to search for only a subset of users or users that have
    different LDAP object classes, you can change this.

- *User Mapping:* The next series of fields allows you to define mappings from
  LDAP attributes to @product@ fields. Though your LDAP user attributes may be
  different from LDAP server to LDAP server, there are five fields @product@
  requires to be mapped for the user to be recognized:

    +   *Screen Name* (e.g., *uid*)

    +   *Password* (e.g., *userPassword*)

    +   *Email Address* (e.g., *mail* or *email*)

    +   *First Name* (e.g., *name* or *givenName*)

    +   *Last Name* (e.g., *sn*)

**Note:** If you intend to create or import users with no email addresses, then
you must set `users.email.address.required=false` in your
`portal-ext.properties`. With this set, Liferay auto-generates an email address
combining the user ID plus the suffix defined in the property
`users.email.address.auto.suffix=`. Finally, make sure to set Liferay and LDAP
authentication to something other than email address.

    If you want to import LDAP groups as @product@ user groups, make sure to
    define a mapping for the @product@ group field so that membership information
    is preserved:

    +   *Group* (e.g., *member*)

    The other LDAP user mapping fields are optional.

The Control Panel provides default mappings for commonly used LDAP attributes.
You can also add your own mappings.

- *Test LDAP Users:* Once you have your attribute mappings set up (see above),
  click the *Test LDAP Users* button and @product@ will attempt to pull LDAP users
  and match them with their mappings as a preview.

![Figure 1: Testing LDAP Users](../../../images/server-configuration-testing-ldap-users.jpg)

**Groups:** This section contains settings for mapping LDAP groups to @product@
user groups.

- *Import Search Filter:* This is the filter for finding the LDAP groups that
  you want to map to @product@ user groups. E.g.,

        (objectClass=groupOfNames)

    Enter the LDAP group attributes you want retrieved for this mapping. The
    following attributes can be mapped. The *Group Name* and *User* fields are
    required, the *Description* is optional.

    + *Group Name* (e.g., *cn* or *o*)

    + *Description* (e.g., *description*)

    + *User* (e.g., *member*)

- *Test LDAP Groups:* Click the *Test LDAP Groups* button to display a list of
  the groups returned by your search filter.

**Export:** This section contains settings for exporting user data from LDAP.

- *Users DN:* Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the users will be
  stored. When @product@ does an export, it will export the users to this
  location.

- *User Default Object Classes:* When a user is exported, the user is created
  with the listed default object classes. To find out what your default object
  classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as JXplorer to locate a user and
  view the Object Class attributes stored in LDAP for that user.

- *Groups DN:* Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the groups will be
  stored. When @product@ does an export, it exports the groups to this location.

- *Group Default Object Classes:* When a group is exported, the group is created
  with the listed default object classes. To find out what your default object
  classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as *Jxplorer* to locate a group and
  view the Object Class attributes stored in LDAP for that group.

![Figure 2: Mapping LDAP Groups](../../../images/server-configuration-mapping-ldap-groups.jpg)

Once you set all your options and tested your connection, click *Save*. From
here, you can add another LDAP server or set just a few more options that apply
to all of your LDAP server connections.

+$$$

**Note:** If a user changes a value like a password in @product@, that change is
passed to the LDAP server, provided @product@ has enough schema access to make
the change. 

$$$

Now you know how to connect an LDAP server to @product@ and how to
configure user import behavior, export behavior, and other LDAP settings.
