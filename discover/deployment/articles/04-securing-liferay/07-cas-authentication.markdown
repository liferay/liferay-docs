# CAS (Central Authentication Service) Single Sign On Authentication [](id=cas-central-authentication-service-single-sign-on-authentication)

CAS is an authentication system originally created at Yale University. It is a
widely used open source single sign-on solution and was the first SSO product to
be supported by @product@. @product@'s CAS module includes the CAS client, so
there's no need to install it separately.

The CAS Server application requires your server to have a properly configured
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate. To generate one yourself, use the
`keytool` utility that comes with the JDK. First generate the key, then export
the key into a file. Finally, import the key into your local Java key store. For
public, Internet-based production environments, you must purchase a signed key
from a recognized certificate authority or have your key signed by a recognized
certificate authority. For Intranets, you should have your IT department
pre-configure users' browsers to accept the certificate so they don't get
warning messages about the certificate.

To generate a key, use the following command:

    keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keyalg RSA

Instead of the password in the example (`changeit`), use a password you can
remember. If you are not using Tomcat, you may want to use a different alias as
well. For first and last names, enter `localhost` or the host name of your
server. It cannot be an IP address.

To export the key to a file, use the following command:

    keytool -export -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -file server.cert

Finally, to import the key into your Java key store, use the following command:

    keytool -import -alias tomcat -file server.cert -keypass changeit -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts

If you are on a Windows system, replace `$JAVA_HOME` above with `%JAVA_HOME%`.
Of course, all of this must be done on the system where CAS is running.

Once your CAS server is up and running, configure @product@ to use it.
CAS configuration can be applied either at the system scope or at the scope of
a portal instance. To configure the CAS SSO module at the system scope,
navigate to the Control Panel, click on *Configuration* &rarr; *System
Settings* &rarr; *Security* &rarr; *SSO*. The values configured there provide
the default values for all portal instances. Enable CAS authentication and then
modify the URL properties to point to your CAS server.

**Enabled:** Check this box to enable CAS single sign-on.

**Import from LDAP:** A user may be authenticated from CAS and not yet exist in
@product@. Select this to automatically import users from LDAP if they do not
exist in @product@. For this to work, LDAP must be enabled.

The rest of the settings are various URLs, with defaults included. Change
*localhost* in the default values to point to your CAS server. When you are
finished, click *Save*. After this, when users click the *Sign In* link, they
will be directed to the CAS server to sign in to @product@.

For some situations, it might be more convenient to specify the system
configuration via files on the disk. To do so, create the following
file:

    {LIFERAY_HOME}/osgi/configs/com.liferay.portal.security.sso.cas.configuration.CASConfiguration.cfg

The format of this file is the same as any properties file. The key to use for
each property that can be configured is shown below. Enter values in the same
format as you would when initializing a Java primitive type with a literal
value.

Property Label | Property Key | Description | Type
----- | ----- | ----- | -----
**Enabled** | `enabled` | Check this box to enable CAS SSO authentication. | `boolean`
**Import from LDAP** | `importFromLDAP` | Users authenticated from CAS that do not exist in @product@ are imported from LDAP. LDAP must be enabled separately. | `boolean`
**Login URL** | `loginURL` | Set the CAS server login URL. | `String`
**Logout on session expiration** | `logoutOnSessionExpiration` | If checked, browsers with expired sessions are redirected to the CAS logout URL. | `boolean`
**Logout URL** | `logoutURL` | The CAS server logout URL. Set this if you want @product@'s logout function to trigger a CAS logout | `String`
**Server Name** | `serverName` | The name of the @product@ instance (e.g., `liferay.com`). If the provided name includes the protocol (`https://`, for example) then this will be used together with the path `/c/portal/login` to construct the URL to which the CAS server will provide tickets. If no scheme is provided, the scheme normally used to access the @product@ login page will be used. | `String`
**Server URL** | `serviceURL` | If provided, this will be used as the URL to which the CAS server provides tickets. This overrides any URL constructed based on the Server Name as above. | `String`
**No Such User Redirect URL** | `noSuchUserRedirectURL` | Set the URL to which to redirect the user if the user can authenticate with CAS but cannot be found in @product@. If import from LDAP is enabled, the user is redirected if the user could not be found or could not be imported from LDAP. | `String`

To override system defaults for a particular portal instance, navigate to the
Control Panel, click on *Configuration* &rarr; *Instance Settings*, click on
*Authentication* on the right and then on *CAS* at the top.
