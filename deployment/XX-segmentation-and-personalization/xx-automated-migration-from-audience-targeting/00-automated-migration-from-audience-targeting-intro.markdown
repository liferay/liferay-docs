# Migrating From Audience Targeting to Segmentation and Personalization

@product-ver@ integrates all the features of the old Audience Targeting app 
into Liferay's core as Segmentation and Personalization. This enables better 
integration with other applications and provides developers with easier access 
to Segmentation and Personalization features. Audience Targeting users will need to migrate their user segments into the new Segments application. To help you through this process, Liferay provides a semi-automated migration with the 7.2 platform upgrade [Link to upgrade instructions].

[TBD. The same applies for Audience Targeting display portlets and the new Modern Site Building Experience-based personalization [LINK TO MIGRATING DISPLAY PORTLETS SECTION]].
