# Deploying Liferay Portal [](id=deploying-liferay)

@product@ is one of the most flexible applications on the market today with
respect to database and application server support. It supports a wide variety
of databases and application servers, freeing you to use the ones you want.
@product@ also scales very well. You can install it on a shared hosting account,
on a multi-node cluster running a commercial application server, or on anything
in between. In fact, @product@ is used successfully in all of these scenarios
every day. Here are the deployment topics:

-   [Obtaining @product@](/deployment/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-2/obtaining-liferay)

-   [Preparing for install](/deployment/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-2/preparing-for-install)

-   [Installing @product@ from a bundle](/deployment/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-2/installing-liferay)

-   Installing @product@ manually on the various application servers. 

-   [Setting up Marketplace](/deployment/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-2/setting-up-marketplace)

You'll find that because @product@ is extremely flexible in its deployment
options, it is also easy to install. If you already have an application server,
you can use your application server's deployment tools to install @product@. If
you don't already have an application server, Liferay provides several
application server bundles from which to choose. These are pre-configured
application servers with @product@ already installed on them. They're easy to
install and with a small amount of configuration can be made into
production-ready systems.

There are some preparations to make before installing. You must create
a database and install a supported Java Development Kit (JDK). It can also be
worthwhile to pre-configure or gather information for configuring a data source,
mail session, and more. You'll get guidance for these preparations. 

Lastly, you'll install and deploy @product@ for the first time and then set up
Marketplace. You can continue configuring and tuning as you desire. 

Read on to obtain the @product@ installer that's right for you.
