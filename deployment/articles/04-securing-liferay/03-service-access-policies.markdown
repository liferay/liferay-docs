# Service Access Policies

*Service access policies* comprise a layer of web service security that defines
services or service methods that can be invoked remotely. You can apply many of
them at once to produce a combined effect. To help you understand how service
access policies fit into the big picture, here's a summary of @product@'s web
service security layers:

**IP permission layer:** The IP address from which a web service invocation
request originates must be white-listed in the portal properties file. A web
service invocation coming from a non-whitelisted IP address automatically fails.

**Service access policy layer:** Methods corresponding to a web service
invocation request must be whitelisted by each service access policy that's in
effect. You can use wildcards to reduce the number of service classes and
methods that must be explicitly whitelisted.

**Authentication/verification layer (browser-only):** If a web service invocation
request comes from a browser, the request must include an authentication token.
This authentication token is the value of the `p_auth` URL parameter. The token
is generated by @product@ and associated with your browser session. The `p_auth`
parameter is automatically supplied when you invoke a @product@ web service via
the JSON web services API page or via JavaScript using `Liferay.Service(...)`.
If @product@ cannot associate the caller's authentication token with a User, the
web service invocation request fails.

**User permission layer:** Properly implemented web services have permission
checks. The user invoking a web service must have permission to invoke the
service.

![Figure 1: To get to a service, a request must pass through the door lock of user permissions, the padlock of the verification layer, the brick wall of service access policies, and finally the safe of predefined IP permissions.](../../images/service-access-policies-security-layers.png)

Note that service access policies respect the permissions system. If a service
access policy grants a user access to a remote service, the user must still have
the appropriate permissions to invoke that service.

Service access policies are especially useful when remote applications such as
mobile devices or Liferay Sync instances must access web services.
Administrators can use service access policies to ensure that these devices can
only invoke remote services from approved lists that can be modified at runtime.

## Managing Service Access Policies

Navigate to the Control Panel and click on *Service Access Policy* under the
Configuration heading. Here, you can see the default service access policies and
add new ones. When creating or editing service access policies, keep these
points in mind:

- Service access policy names must be unique per portal instance.
- Service access policy names can include only these allowed characters:

        0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz#:@-./_

- Service access policy titles can be localized; service access policy names
  cannot be localized.
- Allowed service signatures must be entered one per line. Wildcards (`*`) are
  allowed for both class names and method names. The `#` symbol must be used to
  separate a class name from a method name. 

For example, `com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.UserService` allows any method
from the `UserService` class to be invoked.
`com.liferay.document.library.kernel.service.DLAppService#get*` allows any
method from the `DLAppService` that starts with `get` to be invoked. Thus,

```java
com.liferay.portal.kernel.service.UserService
com.liferay.document.library.kernel.service.DLAppService#get*
```

allows any method from the `UserService` class to be invoked and any method
from the `DLAppService` whose name starts with `get` to be invoked.

There are 16 service access policies that are enabled by default. Six of these
have to do with the system: 

**ASSET_ENTRY_DEFAULT:** Allows the view counter for assets to be updated when an
asset is retrieved.

**CALENDAR_DEFAULT:** Makes it possible to search public events
in the calendar.

**SYNC_DEFAULT:** Allows only the
`com.liferay.sync.service.SyncDLObjectService.getSyncContext` method. It applies
to every Liferay Sync request, including unauthenticated Sync requests.

**SYNC_TOKEN:** Allows `com.liferay.sync.service.*`, meaning that any API
function that's a method of a class in this package can be invoked. It applies
to Sync requests which are accompanied by an authentication token.

**SYSTEM_DEFAULT:** Allows access to country/region services by JavaScript
calls, so users can switch languages on the fly. Applies to every request,
including unauthenticated requests.

**SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD:** Allows any method to be invoked. Of course, since API
functions include permission checks, this call works only if the user has the
required permission. It applies to requests for which
`AuthVerifierResult.isPasswordBasedAuthentication` is `true`: i.e., whenever
user authentication took place using a password. If you want to completely
disallow certain API functions from being invoked, you can change the
`SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD` policy to something more restrictive than `*`.

`SYNC_DEFAULT` and `SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, as their names suggest, are default
service access policies. Default service access policies are applied to all
incoming requests, including unauthenticated requests. 

The other 10 policies have to do with OAuth and 
[JSON web services](/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/invoking-json-web-services): 

**OAUTH2_analytics.read/write:** Integrates with 
[Liferay Analytics Cloud](https://www.liferay.com/products/analytics-cloud), 
allowing it access to JSON web services. 

**OAUTH2_everything/read/documents/userprofile/write:** The Everything policies
grant access to all the JSON web services for various reasons. Everything is
everything: all JSON web services (matches `*`). The others match method
signatures appropriate to their description. For example, OAUTH2_everything.read
matches all methods starting with `fetch`, `get`, `has`, `is`, or `search`. 

**OAUTH_READ/WRITE:** These provide access to JSON web services via the OAuth
1.0a plugin. 

The default configuration opens access to all web services shipped with the
system. Administrators should review the ones you want to use and disable the
others. 

You can create new default service access policies: 

1.  Navigate to the *Configuration* &rarr; *Service Access Policy* section of
    the Control Panel. 
 
2.  Click *Add* (![add](../../images/icon-add.png)). 
 
3.  Give your policy a name. 

4.  Flip the switch to enable your policy.

5.  If you want the policy applied to unauthenticated requests as well as
    authenticated requests, flip the switch labeled *Default*. 

6.  Give your policy a localized title. 

7.  Under Allowed Service Signatures, start typing the fully qualified name of
    a service class that's installed. Code completion helps you find the class.
    For example, if you're creating a policy for Liferay's Knowledge Base
    application, you could enter
    `com.liferay.knowledge.base.service.KBArticleService`. 

8.  Under Method Name, start typing a service method call. Again, code
    completion helps you. For Knowledge Base, you could enter `getKBArticle`. 

9.  To specify another service or method, click the plus icon to add another
    entry. 

10. When done, click *Save*. 

| **Note:** If you know all the method signatures ahead of time, you can click
| *Switch to Advanced Mode* and enter them all in one field on separate lines.

Liferay applications can declare their own default policies (the `SYNC_DEFAULT`
policy is a good example). This policy can then be changed or disabled by
administrators. In this case, the plugin can still verify that the policy exists
so there is no need to redefine or update it.

By default, Liferay's tunneling servlet uses the `SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD` service
access policy. You can, however, create your own policy for the tunneling
servlet and use the property `service.access.policy.name` for the
`TunnelingServletAuthVerifier` to specify that your policy should be used
instead.

## Service Access Policy Module 

Liferay's service access policy functionality is provided by the Service Access
Policy module. This module includes the following important classes:

- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.service.access.policy.ServiceAccessPolicy`:
  defines the public interface for `ServiceAccessPolicy`.
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.service.access.policy.ServiceAccessPolicyManager`: defines the public interface for retrieving instances of `ServiceAccessPolicy`.
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.service.access.policy.ServiceAccessPolicyManagerUtil`: bridges service access policy functionality to the parts of Liferay's core that have not yet been modularized.
- `com.liferay.portal.kernel.security.service.access.policy.ServiceAccessPolicyThreadLocal`: makes `ServiceAccessPolicy` instances active.

Liferay's Service Access Policy module resides in the
`modules/apps/service-access-policy` folder in the source code. When running,
these three bundles provide the service access policy functionality (they're in
the `[Liferay Home]/osgi/modules` folder):

- `com.liferay.service.access.policy.api.jar`
- `com.liferay.service.access.policy.service.jar`
- `com.liferay.service.access.policy.web.jar`

These modules provide the service access policy management UI that's accessible
from the Control Panel. They also provide the interface and default
implementation for `ServiceAccessPolicy`.

To configure the Service Access Policy module, navigate to the Control Panel,
click on *System Settings*, and find the *Service Access Policies* module in the
Security section. Click on its name to edit it. Here, you can edit the default
service access policy configuration. You can also force a default policy to be
applied even when no policies are applied by the `AuthVerifier`.

There's also an `AuthenticatedAccessControlPolicy`. This policy doesn't do
anything if a `ServiceAccessPolicyManager` implementation is present. If the
service access policy module is disabled, however, the
`AuthenticatedAccessControlPolicy` provides a fallback that still requires
authenticated access for web services.

## Summary

Great! Now you know service access policies can restrict access to @product@'s web
services. Custom service access policies can be created by portal
administrators. They are applied by the portal's token authenticator, e.g., by
OAuth.
