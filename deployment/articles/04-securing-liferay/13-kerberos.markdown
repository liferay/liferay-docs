# Authenticating with Kerberos

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can use Kerberos to authenticate Microsoft Windows &trade; accounts with
@product@. This is done completely through configuration by using a combination
of @product@'s LDAP support and a web server that supports the Kerberos
protocol. 

Note that this configuration is preferred above 
[NTLM](/docs/7-1/deploy/-/knowledge_base/deploy/ntlm-single-sign-on-authentication)
because security vulnerabilities persist. 

While it's beyond the scope of this article to explain how to set up Kerberos
and Active Directory on a Windows &trade; server, we can describe the minimum
prerequisites for setting up Liferay authentication: 

1.  A Windows &trade; server with Active Directory and DNS set up so the AD
    server and @product@ can resolve each other on the network. In other words,
    they must be able to ping each other *by name*. 

2.  An administrative user in AD @product@ can use to bind to AD. 

3.  A Kerberos keytab file exported via the `ktpass` command containing the
    cryptographic information the @product@ server needs to bind to AD. 

4.  A web server in front of @product@ that supports Kerberos, such as Apache,
    NGNIX, or IIS. The web server must also support injecting a header to be used 
    as a token in the @product@ configuration (see below). 

5.  Of course, you need a @product@ installation that can also resolve by name
    the other servers. It should never run on the Active Directory server.

When you have all of these prerequisites in place, you're ready to configure
Kerberos authentication. 

## How Kerberos Authentication Works

From the prerequisites, you may be able to guess that there are several moving
parts to how SSO works with Kerberos. 

![Figure 1: Kerberos authentication requires a web server in front of your @product@ server.](../../images/kerberos.png)

First, a properly configured web browser sends a negotiate request using
encrypted Windows user data. To configure this, the browser must recognize the
site as a trusted site (explained below). The web server's Kerberos module uses
the keytab file to bind over the Kerberos protocol to AD and verify the user
information. If all is okay, the AD server confirms the connection with a valid
response. 

The web server you choose must support both the Kerberos protocol and the
injection of a custom header into the request that @product@ can later read.
When the web server forwards the request to @product@, it reads the header to
obtain the user data and authenticate the user. 

Next, you'll learn how to get all of this working. 

## Configuring Kerberos Authentication

There are four components to configure: a user keytab from Active
Directory, a web server in front of your application server, @product@, and your
Windows&trade; clients. 

### Creating the User Keytab

1.  Create a user so @product@ can bind to Active Directory. 

2.  Generate a Kerberos keytab file using `ktpass`: 

        ktpass -princ HTTP/[web server host name]@[domain] -mapuser [user name]@[domain] -crypto ALL -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL -pass [password] -out c:\kerberos.keytab

    For example: 

        ktpass -princ HTTP/mywebserver.intdomain.local@INTDOMAIN.LOCAL -mapuser Marta@INTDOMAIN.LOCAL -crypto ALL -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL -pass password-for-Marta -out c:\kerberos.keytab

3.  Ensure that the AD domain controller and the web server can see each other
    on the network via DNS configuration or `hosts` file. 

### Configuring Your Web Server

1.  Configure Kerberos authentication. On Linux, this involves installing `krb5`
    and configuring it to match your realm that's already configured for Active
    Directory. The example domain for the user configured in step two above
    would look like this: 

        [libdefaults]
        	default_realm = INTDOMAIN.LOCAL

        [domain_realm]
            mywebserver.intdomain.local = INTDOMAIN.LOCAL
            intdomain.local = INTDOMAIN.LOCAL
            .intdomain.local = INTDOMAIN.LOCAL

        [realms]
        INTDOMAIN.LOCAL = {
            admin_server = winserver.intdomain.local
            kdc = winserver.intdomain.local
        }

2.  Copy the keytab file you generated on your AD server to your web server. 

3.  Configure your web server, making sure you set the correct server name,
    Kerberos service name, Kerberos authentication realms, and the path to the
    keytab file. For example, if you're using the Apache HTTP server, the
    configuration might look like this: 

        LoadModule headers_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_headers.so
        LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so
        LoadModule proxy_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy.so
        LoadModule proxy_http_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_http.so
        LoadModule proxy_ajp_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_ajp.so
        LoadModule auth_kerb_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_kerb.so

        <VirtualHost *:10080>
            <Proxy *>
                Order deny,allow
                Allow from all
            </Proxy>
            ProxyRequests     Off
            ProxyPreserveHost On
            ProxyPass / ajp://localhost:8009/
            ProxyPassReverse / ajp://localhost:8009/
            ServerName mywebserver.intdomain.local
            <Location />
                        Order allow,deny
                        Allow from all
                        AuthType Kerberos
                        KrbServiceName HTTP/mywebserver.intdomain.local@INTDOMAIN.LOCAL
                        AuthName "Domain login"
                        KrbAuthRealms INTDOMAIN.LOCAL
                        Krb5KeyTab /etc/apache2/kerberos.keytab
                        require valid-user
                        KrbMethodNegotiate  On
                        KrbMethodK5Passwd   Off
                        #KrbLocalUserMapping On

                        # Below directives put logon name of authenticated user into http header X-User-Global-ID
                        RequestHeader unset X-User-Global-ID
                        RewriteEngine On
                        RewriteCond   %{LA-U:REMOTE_USER} (.+)
                        RewriteRule   /.* - [E=RU:%1,L,NS]
                        RequestHeader set X-User-Global-ID %{RU}e

                        # Remove domain suffix to get the simple logon name
                        #RequestHeader edit X-User-Global-ID "@INTLAND.LOCAL$" ""

            </Location>
        </VirtualHost>
        Listen 10080

It is possible to map Kerberos only to the authentication process. In this case,
you would proxy only to the login URL. This changes your reverse proxy
configuration. For Apache, the lines above for `ProxyPass` and
`ProxyPassReverse` would change to this: 

    ProxyPass / ajp://localhost:8009/c/portal/login
    ProxyPassReverse / ajp://localhost:8009/c/portal/login

If you're using a different web server, configure it appropriately. 

### Connecting @product@ to Active Directory over LDAP

1.  Finally, configure @product@ to access Active Directory via the LDAP
    protocol. Change authentication to be by Screen Name by selecting it in
    Configuration &rarr; Instance Settings &rarr; Authentication &rarr; General. 

2.  Connect @product@ to AD over LDAP by going to Configuration &rarr; Instance
    Settings &rarr; Authentication &rarr; LDAP and adding an LDAP server.
    Provide the information appropriate to your installation: 

    **Base Provider URL:** Your AD server on the proper port. 

    **Base DN:** Your domain configuration. The example above might be
    `DC=INTDOMAIN.DC=LOCAL`. 

    **Principal/Credentials:** Supply the credentials for the user exported to
    the keytab file. 

    **Authentication Search Filter:** Supply the appropriate search filter to
    return user objects. For example,
    `(&(objectCategory=person)(sAMAccountName=*))`

    **UUID:** Supply what uniquely identifies a user, such as `sAMAccountName`. 

    **Screen Name:** Supply the field that should be mapped to @product@'s
    screen name field, such as `sAMAccountName`. 

    **Password:** Supply the field that contains the user's password, such as
    `userPassword`. 

3.  Be sure to test the connection, save, and enable the configuration. 

4.  Finally, configure the token for single sign-on at Configuration &rarr;
    System Settings &rarr; Security &rarr; SSO &rarr; Token Based SSO. Make sure
    the User Token Name matches *exactly* the token you configured in your web
    server. Click the *Enabled* and *Import from LDAP* boxes and click *Save*. 

Excellent! You've configured your servers. All that's left is to configure your
clients. 

### Configuring your Clients

You must do two things: make your computer log into the domain and configure
your @product@ server as a trusted Internet site. 

1.  Join your computer to your domain. In keeping with the example above, you'd
    make your computer a member of the `INTDOMAIN.LOCAL` domain. 

2.  Log in as a user in that domain. 

3.  Internet Explorer, Edge, and Chrome use the Windows&trade; settings for
    trusted sites. If you use these browsers, go to Internet Options &rarr;
    Security &rarr; Local Intranet Sites and add your @product@ server's URL.
    For example, add `http://mywebserver.intdomain.local:10080`. 

4. Firefox can be configured by typing `about:config` in its address bar. Search
   for the below two preferences and add the @product@ server's URL as the value
   for both: 

   - `network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris`
   - `network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris`

After configuring these things, test your configuration by accessing @product@
through the web server's URL. Since you are already logged into your client
machine, you should be automatically logged into @product@ without
a user/password prompt. 

Congratulations on configuring Kerberos with @product@!
