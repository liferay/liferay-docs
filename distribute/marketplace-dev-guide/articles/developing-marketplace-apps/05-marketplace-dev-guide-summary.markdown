# Summary [](id=summary)

In this chapter, we introduced concepts and instructions for developers to make
their apps available on the Liferay Marketplace. 

We looked at how to create, publish, maintain, and track Liferay Marketplace
apps. You can do this through the App Manager that's available on your profile
[liferay.com](http://liferay.com) page ([liferay.com](http://liferay.com)
account required!). Then, we covered the requirements for publishing apps, which
did not differ significantly from requirements for general Liferay development.
Next, we showed how you can publish a sample app on the Marketplace and how you
can modify it as the app evolves. Finally, we looked at how to track the
adoption of apps using view, download, and install metrics. 

In addition to providing application consumers with Marketplace, Liferay
provides a Plugin Security Manager to help protect a consumer's portal from
potentially negative side-affects that can possibly be caused by an app. The
Plugin Security Manager's job is to only allow an app to use resources that the
app has specified up-front in its Portal Access Control List (PACL). As such,
you'll want to know how to create PACLs for the apps you develop. You can learn
more about Liferay Plugin Security and PACLs in the
