# Planning Your App's Distribution [](id=planning-your-apps-distribution)

When you start the formal process of submitting your app to the Marketplace, in
addition to uploading your app's files you'll need to answer a host of important
questions. For example, you'll need to clarify who owns the app, specify pricing
for the app, define its licensing scheme (if it's a paid app), associate a
person or company as its owner and maintainer, and specify the versions of
Liferay that the app supports. Your answers to these questions will also help
you determine whether you'll need to package multiple versions of the app. This
tutorial prepares you by explaining the questions and ways you might answer
them.
