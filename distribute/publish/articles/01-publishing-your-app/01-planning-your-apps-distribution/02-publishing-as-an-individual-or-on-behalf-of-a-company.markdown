# Publishing as an Individual or on Behalf of a Company [](id=publishing-as-an-individual-or-on-behalf-of-a-company)

You can publish an app as yourself (an individual) or on behalf of a *company*.
This determines who is shown as the app's author and owner. Your selection also
determines who can access the app behind the scenes, once it's published. 

The default option is publishing on behalf of yourself. If you go with this
option, your name shows as the app's author/owner in the Marketplace. The term
*personal app* refers to an app published by an individual. That individual is
the only one who can manage the personal app. Managing an app includes such
duties as adding new releases to it, adding new versions of it, and editing its
details. 

Publishing on behalf of a company effectively hands the keys over to the
company's administrators. The app shows on the company's Marketplace app
development page and in the company's list of apps on the company's public
profile page. Company admins have the same permission that an individual author
has to manage the app (add new releases, new versions, edit details, etc.). The
company's name alone is shown as the app's author/owner. 

You can
[register](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/become-a-developer)
yourself as a Marketplace Developer or one of your company's administrators can
register the company as a Marketplace Developer. You can either register for a
Free Basic Account or register for a Paid App Developer Account. A Paid App
Developer Account lets you submit paid apps to the Liferay Marketplace for sale
to customers globally. It enables you to monetize the benefits of the
Marketplace and the benefits of the Liferay distribution channel. The best part
is, you can upgrade to a Paid App Developer Account if and when you want to
submit a paid app to the Marketplace! Here's a comparison of the Marketplace
developer account options:
