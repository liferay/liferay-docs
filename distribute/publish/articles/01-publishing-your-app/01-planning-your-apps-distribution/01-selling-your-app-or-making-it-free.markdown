# Selling Your App or Making it Free [](id=selling-your-app-or-making-it-free)

Do you want to sell your app on the Marketplace? Or do you want to share
it freely with anyone on the Marketplace? It's up to you. Most of the content that
follows describes options for paid apps (apps you sell). 

If you're selling your app, you must publish using a *Paid App Account*. You
must also specify licensing, a price structure, and regional availability for
your paid apps.

Importantly, you can't change the app from free to paid or from paid to free
once the app is published to the Marketplace. Offering the app in in both
license types requires submitting another app under a different name (title). If
you want both free and paid licenses for your app, you must submit the app under
one name for free licenses and under another name for paid licenses. Make sure
you select the license type (i.e., free or paid) that's best for your app. 

Have you decided who to list as the app's author/owner? Have you decided manages
the app once it's on the Marketplace? App ownership options are explained next.
