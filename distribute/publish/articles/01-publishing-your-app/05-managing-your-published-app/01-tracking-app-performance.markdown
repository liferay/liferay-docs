# Tracking App Performance [](id=tracking-app-performance)

One of the main reasons for developing and publishing apps on Marketplace is to
drive app downloads and adoption. Marketplace gives you detailed reports on
views, downloads, and purchases of your app(s). To access these metrics,
navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Metrics* (under *Development*). 

![Figure 1: The App Performance view in Marketplace lets you see how many times your apps have been viewed, downloaded, and purchased over a time interval.](../../../images/marketplace-app-metrics-over-time.png) 

The view shown above is the default metrics view for a developer's apps. Across
the bottom is a list of data series options (*Views*, *Downloads*, or
*Purchases*). At the top, you set a date range. In the middle, a graph shows the
data within the date range. Finally, the graphed data is also shown in tabular
format, in case you want to know the exact values making up the graph. The
different types of data available to view are described below.

## Views [](id=views)

When someone searches or browses the Marketplace, they click on apps to see
their details. When this occurs for an app, Marketplace records a *View* for
it. When you select *Views* in the App Metrics screen, the app view count over
time appears. The App Metrics screen shows *Views* by default. The number of
possible views per day per user is unlimited.

## Downloads [](id=downloads)

Marketplace records a *Download* for your app when someone downloads any package
of any version of your app. The number of possible downloads per day per user is
unlimited.

## Purchases [](id=purchases)

The Marketplace counts app purchases too. 

As you see areas to improve your app or when necessary changes come up, you can
make changes to your published app. The next article describes changes you can
make.
