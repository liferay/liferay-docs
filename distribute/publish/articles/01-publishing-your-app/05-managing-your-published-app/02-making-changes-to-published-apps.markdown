# Making Changes to Published Apps [](id=making-changes-to-published-apps)

You can make these kinds of changes during the life of your published app:

- Edit your app details (e.g., description, icon, etc.)
- Add new license bundles (quantities)
- Edit app prices of bundles
- Modify regional availability
- Add support for a new version of Liferay
- Release a new version of your app to fix bugs or offer new functionality
- Disable your app

Your currently approved app remains available while you're submitting changes
and while Liferay reviews and tests your app changes. 

The rest of this article describes each kind of change. 

## Editing Your App's Metadata [](id=editing-your-app-details)

App metadata includes the name, description, icon, screenshots, and other
information you supplied during the app creation process. Here's how to edit
your app's metadata:

1.  Navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Development* &rarr; *Apps*. A listing of 
    your published apps appears. 

2.  Select the app you wish to edit. This screen shows you what the app looks 
    like on Marketplace. 

3.  Click the *Edit* button at the bottom of the preview. Now you can edit 
    details and add new files to the your existing version of your app. The
    current values as they appear in your app pre-populate the form. 

4.  Make any changes as needed on this screen.

5.  Click *Next*. If you don't need to edit any more variations, you can 
    continue clicking *Next* until you reach the final preview screen.

6.  Click *Submit for Review* to submit your changes for review.

All changes must go through the submission process. If your app revision only
consists of metadata changes, it need only go through the 
[*App metadata review*](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/understanding-the-app-review-process)
phase of the review process. 

Once approved, the changes you request appear for your app on the Marketplace.

## Editing App Prices [](id=editing-app-prices)

You can change your app's prices, add or remove bundles, and modify regional
availability for a variety of reasons, whether it's to run a promotional offer,
or to adjust your pricing model to better account for app demand. Here's how to
edit app prices:

1.  Navigate to *Company Profile Home* &rarr; *Apps*. A listing of your 
    published apps appears. 

2.  Select the app you wish to edit.

3.  At the bottom, click *Edit* &rarr; *Pricing*.

4.  Edit your app's prices.

5.  When you've finished editing your app's prices, click *Next* and save your 
    app. 

These changes do not require Liferay verification process to approve. The
changes show immediately. 

You cannot however, modify the following attributes of an approved app: 

- Free vs. paid
- License term (perpetual vs. non-perpetual)
- Support subscription offering (cannot be removed)

Next, you can consider adding support for new versions of Liferay. 

## Adding Support for New Versions of Liferay [](id=adding-support-for-new-versions-of-liferay-portal)

If you must add files to support another Liferay release, the process is similar
to editing an app.

1.  Navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps*. A listing of your published apps 
    appears. 

2.  Select the app you wish to edit. 

3.  Click the *Edit* button to edit that app. 

4.  Click *Next* to advance past the details screen (make any necessary 
    changes). The version edit screen appears. 

5.  Click *Next* to advance past the version edit screen (you can't actually 
    edit the version number of an already-approved version, but you can edit the
    "What's New" information). The File Upload screen appears.

    This screen should look familiar---it's the same workflow used when you
    initially created your app! The difference is that you can't edit
    pre-approved files for specific Liferay releases. You can only add *new*
    files for a different Liferay release (if you must update existing files,
    you must create a new version of the app---see the later section on adding
    versions for details on how to do this).

6.  Upload your new files (ensuring that your new plugins have updated 
    compatibility information: see the
    [Marketplace App Metadata Guidelines](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/preparing-your-app)
    for details on versions). 

7.  Click *Next*, and observe the newly-added files listed at the bottom of the 
    preview screen.

8.  Click *Submit for Review* to submit your requested change (adding files). 

Liferay reviews the files, and once approved, the new package becomes available
for download in the Marketplace.

## Releasing a New Version of your App [](id=releasing-a-new-version-of-your-app)

As time passes, you may wish to add new functionality to your app or fix a batch
of bugs. This can be accomplished by releasing a new version of your app. New
versions offer your users new functionality and bug fixes, and users are
generally encouraged to use the latest version. In addition, when a new version
of your app becomes available, Marketplace notifies existing users. 

New versions of your apps are created in a similar fashion to creating new apps.

1.  Navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps*. A listing of your published apps 
    appears. 

2.  Select the app you wish to edit. 

3.  Click the *Edit* button to edit that app. The Details screen appears.

4.  At the bottom of the Details screen, click the *Add New Version* button. The
    process of adding a new version begins, starting with the App Details
    screen. Data from the current version of the app pre-populates the screen. 

    You can modify the screen's pre-populated data. Since this is a new version
    of an existing app, making major changes (such as completely changing the
    name or description) might unsettle existing users. Uploading new
    screenshots and refreshing app icons is common. Note that you cannot change
    the app owner (such as moving from a personally-developed app to a
    company-developed app).

5.  Click *Next* until you get to the *Add App Version* screen. 

6.  Specify a new version name for this version of your app.

7.  Add *What's New* text (optional). Common changes to mention are new features
    and bug fix information. 

8.  Click *Next*. The file upload screen appears. 

9.  Upload the files associated with the new version of the app. You must upload
    all files for all supported Liferay versions again, even if they have not
    changed since the last version of your app. 

10. Continue clicking *Next* until you reach the final preview screen.
    
11. Click *Submit for Review* to submit the new version of your app for review.

The Liferay Marketplace staff starts to review your app's new version and test
it. 

## Deactivating Your App [](id=deactivating-your-app)

When the time comes to retire your app, you can *Deactivate* it. Deactivating an
app makes it unavailable to new customers, and it doesn't appear in any public
Marketplace listings. Existing customers that have already downloaded your app
can continue downloading the legacy versions of the app they have already
acquired, but they can't download any versions they've not already received. The
app remains in your inventory, with all of its history, in case you choose to
re-activate or reference it.

Here's how to deactivate your app:

1.  Navigate to *Account Home* &rarr; *Apps*. A listing of your published apps 
    appears. 

2.  Select the app you wish to deactivate. 

3.  Click the *Deactivate* button. 

In this set of articles, we looked at how to create, publish, maintain, and
track Liferay Marketplace apps. You can do this through the App Manager that's
available on your *Account Home* page on [liferay.com](http://liferay.com)
(liferay.com) account required!). We covered requirements for publishing
variations of your apps for different versions of Liferay. Next, we showed how
you can publish an app on the Marketplace and how you can modify the app as it
evolves. Finally, we looked at tracking app adoption using view, download, and
install metrics.
