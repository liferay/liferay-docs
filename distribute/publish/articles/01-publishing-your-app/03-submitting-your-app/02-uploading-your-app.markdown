# Uploading Your App [](id=uploading-your-app)

On this screen, you must specify your app's version and upload your app's files. 
Note that the article 
[Planning Your App's Distribution](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/planning-your-apps-distribution) 
helps you plan your app's versioning scheme. Likewise, the article 
[Preparing Your App](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/preparing-your-app) 
helps you determine which files to upload. 

To start uploading, click *Browse* and select the files that make up your app. 
Each time you add a file, it automatically begins to upload and its 
compatibility information is scanned. You must upload at least one file before 
advancing beyond this screen. Once the files are successfully uploaded, a check 
mark appears next to each plugin, and the plugins are displayed based on their 
compatibility information.

If you selected *Free* for your app pricing, click *Next* to advance to the 
final screen. If you selected *Paid*, you'll be presented with additional 
options for licensing and pricing your app.
