In this chapter, we explored Liferay's asset framework. Any type of content in
Liferay is considered an asset and can utilize the features provided by the
asset framework: tags, categories, comments, ratings, and relationships. We
examined the Asset Publisher portlet and looked at the many configuration
options for choosing what kinds of assets to display and how to display them. We
saw that the Asset Publisher portlet is designed to integrate with the Tags
Navigation and Categories navigation portlets to allow users to browse content
more easily. We also learned about the Display Page attribute of web content,
the Content Display Page page template, and canonical URLs for assets. Assets
can have display page associated with them so that the full view of the asset is
displayed on the display page. The display page of an asset is used in the
asset's canonical URL.
