Liferay Portal is an easy environment to maintain. Backup procedures are simple
and straightforward. Administrators have all the options they need to view and
diagnose a running Liferay Portal server through its tunable logs. Patching
Liferay is easy to do with Liferay's patching tool. It handles for you all the
management of available patches, and makes it easy to install and uninstall
them. Upgrading Liferay is also a snap, because Liferay does most of the work
automatically. With easy migration tools and automated database upgrade scripts,
you'll have your new version of Liferay Portal up and running in no time. It's
also easy and secure for Liferay administrators to remotely access both built-in
Liferay web services and custom services created using Service Builder.
