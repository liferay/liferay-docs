# Kaleo Forms: Defining Business Processes [](id=kaleo-forms-defining-business-processes-lp-6-2-use-useportal)

![EE Only Feature](../../images/ee-feature-web.png)

In the last chapter, you saw the elements that comprise a workflow
definition and learned how to create a workflow definition. In this chapter,
you'll learn about the Kaleo Forms Admin application for Liferay EE. This
application lets you create workflow definitions using an intuitive UI. Using
the workflow designer saves you the time and trouble of having to deal directly
with the XML.

Developers who are used to working with XML can create workflow definitions with
little struggle. Other users may not be so comfortable with it. In fact, even
skilled developers can make mistakes that break a definition and require time to
troubleshoot. To help streamline the creation of workflow definitions and
empower more users to create custom workflows, Liferay provides the Kaleo Forms
Admin application in Liferay 6.2 EE.

There are two pieces to the workflow designer: *Kaleo Forms Admin* and *Kaleo
Forms Display*. These two portlets are included in the Kaleo Forms app and can 
be downloaded from Liferay Marketplace. Kaleo Forms Admin contains a wizard that
guides you through each step in the creation of a workflow process. This
includes a drag and drop interface for creating new workflow definitions without
having to write XML. Kaleo Forms Display allows you to work with a process in
its associated workflow. In other words, Kaleo Forms Admin is for *creating*
workflow processes, while Kaleo Forms Display is for *using* them.

Let's look at Kaleo Forms Admin first.
