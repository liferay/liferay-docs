# Configuring Liferay Applications [](id=configuring-liferay-applications-lp-6-2-use-useportal)

Just like siblings have common features inherited from their parents,
applications that ship with Liferay also share common features. These include
look and feel, communication, scoping, sharing, permissions, archive
configurations, exporting/importing portlet data, and the Recycle Bin. We'll
discuss how these features work together to facilitate information flow within
your portal and provide an enhanced experience for your users. So before we get
into the nitty gritty of the applications themselves, it's best to cover these
common features first, starting with the look and feel configuration options.
