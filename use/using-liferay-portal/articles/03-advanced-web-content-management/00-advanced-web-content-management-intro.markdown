# Advanced Web Content Management [](id=advanced-web-content-management-lp-6-2-use-useportal)

In the previous chapter we looked at some basic ways you can use Liferay to
handle your web content. In this chapter we'll delve deeper into slightly more
complex web content management techniques. But don't be alarmed, it's not too
intense. We'll cover the following topics:

- Web content structures and templates
- RSS Feeds
- Site templates and page templates
- Allowing users to customize site pages
- Staging
- Creating teams to allow for flexible management of site permissions
- Mobile device rules

We'll examine how web content structures and templates provide additional power
and flexibility to the web content management system we saw in chapter 2. You'll
also learn how easy it is to set up and administer multiple sites in Liferay.
Next, we'll learn how you can empower your users to create personal
customizations of site pages. We'll also examine how you can use staging to
manage the publication of pages and content on your site. Well conclude with
sections on creating teams and rules for presenting site pages to mobile
devices. Once finished with this chapter, you'll be the envy of your peers as
they'll think you really know what you're doing.
