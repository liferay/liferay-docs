# Custom Java Tools in the Script Engine [](id=custom-java-tools-in-the-script-engine-lp-6-2-use-useportal)

Users of the Script Engine face several challenges, including debugging and
logging challenges. One approach to overcome these challenges is to develop
custom Java utilities that can be called from your scripts. These utilities can
write to a custom log file or the Liferay log file. You can also place
breakpoints in your utility code and step through it using your favorite
debugger. 

Liferay's use of Spring and `PortletBeanLocatorUtil` makes calling these Java
utilities from your script easy, regardless of the scripting language you're
using. 

Let's begin by creating a Liferay Hook project. If you're using Liferay IDE or
Liferay Developer Studio, select *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Project*.
Name the project *script-utils* and accept the display name generated by the
wizard. Be sure to select *Hook* for the Plugin Type and then select *Finish*.

You're using a Liferay Hook Plugin to deploy your utility, but you're not using
any of the typical hook features. You just need a way to make your code
available to the portal and the Hook Plugin is the least obtrusive way to do
this. This means you don't need to add anything to the `liferay-hook.xml` file.
Instead, you'll begin by adding your utility code. 

You'll be following the Dependency Injection design pattern so begin by creating
the interface. Right-click on the `docroot/WEB-INF/src` folder and select *New*
&rarr; *Interface*. You'll create your interface in the `com.liferay.sample`
package. Name it `ScriptUtil`. 

![Figure 19.2: Create a new Java interface which you'll implement in the next step.](../../images/13-new-interface.png)

Next, add two methods to the interface. 

	package com.liferay.sample;

	public interface ScriptUtil {

		public String operationOne(); 
	
		public String operationTwo(String name); 

	}

Next, create the implementation class. Right-click on the `docroot/WEB-INF/src`
folder and select *New* &rarr; *Class*. Create the class in the
`com.liferay.sample` package and name it `ScriptUtilImpl`. Be sure to select
`com.liferay.sample.ScripUtil` as the Interface. 

![Figure 19.3: Create a new Java Class that implements the interface you created earlier.](../../images/13-new-class.png)

Next, add implementations for the two methods. 

    package com.liferay.sample;

    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.Log;
    import com.liferay.portal.kernel.log.LogFactoryUtil;

    public class ScriptUtilImpl implements ScriptUtil {

        @Override
        public String operationOne() { 
        
            return "Hello out there!"; 
        } 

        @Override
        public String operationTwo(String name) { 

            _log.debug("Inside of Operation Two");
            
            return "Hello " + name + "!"; 
        }
        
        private static Log _log = LogFactoryUtil.getLog(ScriptUtilImpl.class); 

    }
	
Liferay makes extensive use of the Spring Framework and you'll be using it here
to inject your implementation class into the application. Spring needs a bean
definition which you'll declare in an XML file named `hook-spring.xml`. Create
a `docroot/WEB-INF/src/META-INF` directory, create the `hook-spring.xml` file in
this folder, and add the following code to `hook-spring.xml`: 

    <?xml version="1.0"?>

    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            default-destroy-method="destroy" default-init-method="afterPropertiesSet"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
            <bean id="com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtil" class="com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtilImpl" />
    </beans>

Upon deployment, you'll need the portal to create a `BeanLocator` for your
plugin. The `BeanLocator` reads the bean definitions you provided. Create a
`docroot/WEB-INF/web.xml` file in your project and add the following code to it:

    <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">
            <context-param>
                    <param-name>portalContextConfigLocation</param-name>
                    <param-value>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/hook-spring.xml</param-value>
            </context-param>
    </web-app>
	
If your project already contains a `docroot/WEB-INF/web.xml` file, you can
simply add the contents of the `<context-param>` element inside of the
`<web-app>` element. Save all of the changes you've made and deploy the hook.
Once the hook has been deployed successfully, the `ScriptUtil` can be used in
your script engine code. 

To see the `ScriptUtil` code in action, navigate back to the *Control Panel*
&rarr; *Server Administration* &rarr; *Script*. Change the script type to Groovy
and enter the following script: 

	myUtil = com.liferay.portal.kernel.bean.PortletBeanLocatorUtil.locate(
        "script-utils-hook", "com.liferay.sample.ScriptUtil")

	println(myUtil.operationOne())

	println(myUtil.operationTwo("Joe Bloggs"))
	
Click *Execute* and you should see the results of your script displayed right
under the script console.
