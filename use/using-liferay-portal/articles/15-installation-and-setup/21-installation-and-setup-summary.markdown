This chapter is a guide to everything about installing Liferay. Whether you
choose a Liferay bundle or an existing application server, Liferay Portal
integrates seamlessly with your enterprise Java environment. It is supported on
more application servers than any other portal platform, allowing you to
preserve your investment in your application server of choice or giving you the
freedom to move to a different application server platform. Liferay is committed
to providing you this freedom: we have 500 test servers certifying our builds
with roughly 10,000 tests per version of Liferay Portal. Each of those tests are
run on all of our different supported combinations of application servers,
databases and operating systems. Because of this, you can be sure we are
committed to supporting you on your environment of choice. You can feel safe
knowing you have the freedom to use the software platform that is best for your
organization and that Liferay Portal runs and performs well on it.
