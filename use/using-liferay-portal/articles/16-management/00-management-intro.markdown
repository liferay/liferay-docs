# User Management [](id=user-management-lp-6-2-use-useportal)

You know how all these retailers advertise themselves as a "one stop shop" for
anything you want? The idea is they have so much stuff that chances are whatever
you're looking for is there. Liferay's Control Panel is something like this. If
you want to create users, organizations, sites, configure permissions and
plugins and pretty much anything else, you can do it from the Control Panel.
When signed in to Liferay as an administrator, you can access the Control Panel
from the Dockbar by clicking *Admin* &rarr; *Control Panel*.

The Control Panel is organized into four main areas: Users, Sites, Apps, and
Configuration. The Users section lets you create and manage users,
organizations, user groups, roles, and password policies. If monitoring has been
enabled for your portal, you can also view all of the live portal sessions of
your users from this area of the Control Panel. In this chapter, we cover the
Users section of the Control Panel and provide examples of some of the user
management concepts we discussed in chapter one: users, organizations, and user
groups. For information about the Sites section of the Control Panel and site
management, please refer to chapters 2 and 3 of this guide. For information
about the Apps section of the Control Panel and plugin managment, please refer
to chapter 14. Finally, for information about the Configuration section of the
Control Panel and managing portal settings, please refer to the next chapter,
chapter 17.

This chapter explains how to use the Control Panel to manage the following:

- Users
- Organizations
- User Groups
- Roles
- Password Policies
- Monitoring

Let's begin our examination of Liferay's Control Panel by looking at how to
manage users in Liferay Portal.
