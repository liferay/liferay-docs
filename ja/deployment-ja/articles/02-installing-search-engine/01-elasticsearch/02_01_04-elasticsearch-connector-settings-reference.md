# Elasticsearch Connector Settings: Reference [](id=elasticsearch-connector-settings-reference)

Elasticsearch is the default search engine for @product-ver@. The *Liferay
Foundation* suite includes an adapter for Elasticsearch called *Liferay Connector to
Elasticsearch 6*. The adapter is configurable through System Settings or an
OSGi configuration file named
`com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.cfg`
and deployed to `[Liferay_Home]/osgi/configs`.

The list below is all the configuration settings for Liferay's default
Elasticsearch adapter, in the order they appear in the System Settings
application (The _Elasticsearch 6_ entry under the _Search_ category):

`clusterName=LiferayElasticsearchCluster`
: A String value that sets the name of the cluster to integrate with. This name
should match the remote cluster when Operation Mode is set to remote.  (See
also: remote operation mode)

`operationMode=EMBEDDED`
: There are two operation modes you can choose from: EMBEDDED or REMOTE. Set to
REMOTE to connect to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. Set to EMBEDDED
to start Liferay with an internal Elasticsearch instance. Embedded operation
mode is unsupported for production environments.

`indexNamePrefix=liferay-`
: Set a String value to use as the prefix for the search index name. The default
value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change it, you must
also perform a *reindex all* operation for the portal and then manually delete
the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.

`indexNumberOfReplicas=`
Set the number of replicas for each index. If left unset, no replicas are used.
A full reindex is required to make changes take effect.

`indexNumberOfShards=`
Set the number of index shards to use when a Liferay index is created. If left
unset, a single shard is used. A full reindex is required to make changes take
effect.

`bootstrapMlockAll=false`
: A boolean setting that, when set to `true`, tries to lock the process address
space into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/setup-configuration-memory.html#bootstrap-memory_lock))
for more information)

`logExceptionsOnly=true`
: A boolean setting that, when set to true, only logs exceptions from
Elasticsearch, and does not rethrow them.

`retryOnConflict=5`
: Set an int value for the number of retries to attempt if a version conflict
occurs because the document was updated between getting it and updating it (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/docs-update.html#_parameters_3)
for more information).

`discoveryZenPingUnicastHostsPort=9300-9400`
: Set a String value for the range of ports to use when building the value for
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of
ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-discovery-zen.html)
for more information).

`networkHost=`
: Set this String value to instruct the node to bind to this hostname or IP
address and publish (advertise) this host to other nodes in the cluster. This is
a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-network.html#common-network-settings)
for more information).

`networkBindHost=`
: Set the String value of the network interface(s) a node should bind to in order
to listen for incoming requests (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-network.html#advanced-network-settings)
for more information).

`networkPublishHost=`
: Set the String value of a single interface that the node advertises to other
nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-network.html#advanced-network-settings)
for more information).

`transportTcpPort=`
: Set the String value for the port to bind for communication between nodes.
Accepts a single value or a range
(see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-transport.html#_tcp_transport)
for more information).

`transportAddresses=localhost:9300`
: Set the String values for the addresses of the remote Elasticsearch nodes to
connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to remote (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.5/transport-client.html)
for more information). Specify as many or few nodes as you see fit.

`clientTransportSniff=true`
: Set this booleant to true to enable cluster sniffing and dynamically discover
available data nodes in the cluster
(see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.5/transport-client.html)
for more information).

`clientTransportIgnoreClusterName=false`
: Set this boolean to true to ignore cluster name validation of connected nodes
(see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.5/transport-client.html)
for more information).

`clientTransportPingTimeout=`
The time (in seconds) the client node waits for a ping response from a node. If
unset, the default Elasticsearch `client.transport.ping_timeout` is used.

`clientTransportNodesSamplerInterval=`
: Set this String value to instruct the client node on how often to sample / ping
the nodes listed and connected (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.5/transport-client.html)
for more information).

`httpEnabled=true`
: Set this boolean to false to disable the http layer entirely on nodes which are
not meant to serve REST requests directly. As this setting was
[deprecated in Elasticsearch 6.3](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-notes-6.3.0.html#deprecation-6.3.0), the connector's corresponding setting is now also deprecated. This setting was only used for configuring the embedded Elasticsearch server, so its deprecation should have minimal impact to production deployments.

`httpCORSEnabled=true`
: Set this boolean to false to disable cross-origin resource sharing, i.e. whether
a browser on another origin can do requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web
front end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-http.html#_settings_2)
for more information).

`httpCORSAllowOrigin=/https?:\\/\\/localhost(:[0-9]+)?/`
: Set the String origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-http.html#_settings_2)
for more information).

`httpCORSConfigurations=`
: Set the String values for custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format
(elasticsearch.yml) (see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/modules-http.html#_settings_2)
for more information).

`additionalConfigurations=`
: Set the String values for custom settings for embedded Elasticsearch, in YML
format. See: Adding Settings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter

`additionalIndexConfigurations=`
: Set the String values for custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML
format (refer to the Elasticsearch Create Index API for more information).
See: Adding Settings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter

`additionalTypeMappings=`
: Set the String values for custom mappings for the `LiferayDocumentType`, in JSON
format (refer to the Elasticsearch Put Mapping API for more information)
See: Adding Settings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter

`overrideTypeMappings=`
Settings here override @product@'s default type mappings. This
is an advanced feature that should be used only if strictly necessary. If you
set this value, the default mappings used to define the Liferay Document Type in
@product@ source code (for example, `liferay-type-mappings.json`) are ignored
entirely, so include the whole mappings definition in this property, not just
the segment you're modifying.

`syncSearch=true`
If enabled, search runs on the invoker thread rather than in Elasticsearch's
search thread pool.

The following settings are only available in the Elasticsearch 6 adapter:

## Configurations only Affecting the Embedded Elasticsearch Server [](id=configurations-only-affecting-the-embedded-elasticsearch-server)

These settings (defined above) are only meant to use while configuring the
embedded Elasticsearch server. Configuring these will elicit no effect on
remote Elasticsearch installations:

- `bootstrapMlockAll`
- `discoveryZenPingUnicastHostsPort`
- `networkHost`
- `networkBindHost`
- `networkPublishHost`
- `transportTcpPort`
- `httpEnabled`
- `httpCORSEnabled`
- `httpCORSAllowOrigin`
- `httpCORSConfigurations`
- `syncSearch`

You can easily configure these settings in the System Setting application, or
as mentioned above, you can specify them in a deployable OSGi `.config` file.
