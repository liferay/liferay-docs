# Advanced Configuration of the Liferay Elasticsearch Connector (6.1) [](id=advanced-configuration-of-the-liferay-elasticsearch-connector-6-1)

The default configurations for Liferay's Elasticsearch adapter module are set
in a Java class called `ElasticsearchConfiguration`.

While the Elasticsearch adapter has a lot of configuration options out of the
box, you might find an Elasticsearch configuration you need that isn't provided
by default. In this case, add the configuration options you need. If something
is configurable for Elasticsearch, its configurable using the Elasticsearch
adapter.

## Adding Settings and Mappings to the Liferay Elasticsearch Adapter [](id=adding-settings-and-mappings-to-the-liferay-elasticsearch-adapter)

The available configuration options
<!--available configuration
options](discover/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/elasticsearch-settings)-->
are
divided into two groups: the ones used most often by default and a
catch-all for everything else. If the necessary setting isn't available by
default, you can still configure it with the Liferay Elasticsearch adapter.
Specify the settings you need by using one or more of the
`additionalConfigurations`, `additionalIndexConfigurations`, or
`additionalTypeMappings`, and `overrideTypeMappings` settings.

![Figure 1: You can add Elasticsearch configurations to the ones currently available in System Settings.](../../../../images/cfg-elasticsearch-additional-configs.png)

`additionalConfigurations` defines extra settings (in YAML) for the embedded
Elasticsearch. This is only useful for testing environments using the embedded
Elasticsearch server. Any node settings normally set in `elasticsearch.yml` can be
declared here. See the
[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/index.html)
for a description of all possible node settings.

`additionalIndexConfigurations` defines extra settings (in JSON or
YAML) that are applied to the @product@ index when it's created. For
example, you can create custom analyzers and filters using this setting. For
a complete list of available settings, see the
[Elasticsearch reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/index-modules.html).

Here's an example that shows how to configure
[analysis](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/analysis-intro.html#analysis-intro) that can be applied to a
dynamic template (see below).

    {
    "analysis": {
    "analyzer": {
    "kuromoji_liferay_custom": {
    "filter": [
    "cjk_width",
    "kuromoji_baseform",
    "pos_filter"
    ],
    "tokenizer": "kuromoji_tokenizer"
    }
    },
    "filter": {
    "pos_filter": {
    "type": "kuromoji_part_of_speech"
    }
    }
    }
    }

`additionalTypeMappings` defines extra field mappings for the
`LiferayDocumentType` type definition. These are applied when the index is
created. Add these field mappings in using JSON syntax. For more information see
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/mapping.html)
and
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/indices-put-mapping.html).
Use `additionalTypeMappings` for new field mappings, but do not try to override
existing `properties` mappings. If any of the `properties` mappings set here
overlap with existing mappings, index creation fails. Use
`overrideTypeMappings` to replace the default `properties` mappings.

Here's an example of a
[dynamic template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/dynamic-templates.html)
that uses the analysis configuration above to analyze all string fields that end
with `_ja`.

    {
    "LiferayDocumentType": {
    "dynamic_templates": [
    {
    "template_ja": {
    "mapping": {
    "analyzer": "kuromoji_liferay_custom",
    "index": "analyzed",
    "store": "true",
    "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets",
    "type": "string"
    },
    "match": "\\w+_ja\\b|\\w+_ja_[A-Z]{2}\\b",
    "match_mapping_type": "string",
    "match_pattern": "regex"
    }
    }
    ]
    }
    }

The above code adds a new `template_ja` dynamic template. This overrides the
existing dynamic template with the same name. As with dynamic templates, you can
add sub-field mappings to @product@'s type mapping. These are referred to as
[properties](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/properties.html)
in Elasticsearch.

    {
    "LiferayDocumentType": {
    "properties": {
    "fooName": {
    "index": "true",
    "store": "true",
    "type": "keyword"
    }
    }
    }
    }

See
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/mapping-types.html)
for more details on Elasticsearch's field datatypes.

The above example shows how a `fooName` field might be added to @product@'s type
mapping. Because `fooName` is not an existing property in the mapping, it
works fine. If you try to override an existing property mapping, index
creation fails. Instead use the `overrideTypeMappings` setting to override
`properties` in the mapping.

+$$$

**Note:** To see that your additional mappings have been added to the
`LiferayDocumentType`, use `curl` to access this URL after saving your additions
and re-indexing:

    curl http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

Here's what it would look like for an Elasticsearch instance running on
`localhost:9200`, with a @product@ Company ID of `20116`:

    curl http://localhost:9200/liferay-20116/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

In the above URL, `liferay-20116`is the index name. Including it indicates that
you want to see the mappings that were used to create the index with that name.

$$$

Use `overrideTypeMappings` to override @product@'s default type mappings. This
is an advanced feature that should be used only if strictly necessary. If you
set this value, the default mappings used to define the Liferay Document Type in
@product@ source code (for example, `liferay-type-mappings.json`) are ignored
entirely, so include the whole mappings definition in this property, not just
the segment you're modifying. To make a modification, find the entire list of
the current mappings being used to create the index by navigating to the URL

    http://[HOST]:[ES_PORT]/liferay-[COMPANY_ID]/_mapping/LiferayDocumentType?pretty

Copy the contents in as the value of this property (either into System Settings
or your OSGi configuration file). Leave the opening curly brace `{`, but delete
lines 2-4 entirely:

    "liferay-[COMPANY_ID]": {
    "mappings" : {
    "LiferayDocumentType" : {

Then, from the end of the mappings, delete the concluding three curly braces.

    }
    }
    }

Now modify whatever mappings you'd like. The changes take effect once you save
the changes and trigger a re-index from Server Administration. If you need to add
new custom mappings without overriding any defaults, use
`additionalTypeMappings` instead.

## Multi-line YAML Configurations [](id=multi-line-yaml-configurations)

If you configure the settings from the last section using an OSGi configuration
file, you might find yourself needing to write YAML snippets that span multiple
lines. The syntax for that is straightforward and just requires appending each
line with `\n\`, like this:

    additionalConfigurations=\
    cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled: false\n\
    cluster.service.slow_task_logging_threshold: 600s\n\
    index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn: 600s\n\
    index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn: 600s\n\
    index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn: 600s\n\
    monitor.jvm.gc.old.warn: 600s\n\
    monitor.jvm.gc.young.warn: 600s

From simple configurations to overriding existing type mappings, Elasticsearch
and Liferay's connector to Elasticsearch are configurable.
