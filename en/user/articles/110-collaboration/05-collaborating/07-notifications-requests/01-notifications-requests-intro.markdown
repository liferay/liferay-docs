# Managing Notifications and Requests

[TOC levels=1-4]

If you subscribed to a blog or message board, or if someone sent you a
private message, invitation, event reminder, or mentioned you in a post, you
received a notification or request. 

To access notifications and requests, click your user menu and select 
*Notifications*. The *Notifications List* tab is selected by default. This is 
where all your notifications appear. Click the *Requests List* tab to view and 
manage your requests.

## Managing Notifications

Notifications can pile up after some time, especially if you were away for a few
days. The Management Bar gives you several ways to filter and sort your 
notifications. 

The *Filter and Order* menu gives you the following options for viewing 
notifications:

**All:** The default option. Displays both read and unread notifications. 

**Unread:** Displays notifications that haven't been marked as read. Unread 
notifications are indicated with a blue border on the left-hand side of the 
notification. 

**Read:** Displays notifications that have been marked as read. 

**Date:** Order notifications by date. 

By default, notifications are listed by date in descending order. To sort 
notifications by ascending order, click the up/down arrow icon in the management 
bar. Clicking the button again reverses the sort. 

Each notification's *Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) lets you mark the notification as 
read/unread, or delete the notification. 

### Managing Multiple Notifications

You can also manage multiple notifications at once. Select the checkbox next to 
notifications you want to manage and choose an option from the Management Bar. 
Select the checkbox above the notifications list to select all notifications on 
the current page. The Management Bar shows three actions for selected 
notifications: 

-   Mark as Read 
    (![Open Envelope](../../../../images/icon-envelope-open.png))
-   Mark as Unread 
    (![Closed Envelope](../../../../images/icon-envelope-closed.png))
-   Delete 
    (![Delete Button](../../../../images/icon-delete.png))

## Managing Requests

When you get a request, it appears in the *Requests List* tab. In each request's 
*Actions* menu 
(![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)), you can click *Confirm* to 
accept, *Ignore* to decline, or *Delete* to remove the request.
