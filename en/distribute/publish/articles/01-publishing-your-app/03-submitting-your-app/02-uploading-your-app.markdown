# Uploading Your App

[TOC levels=1-4]

On this screen, you must specify your app's version and upload your app's files. 
Note that the article 
[Planning Your App's Distribution](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/planning-your-apps-distribution) 
helps you plan your app's versioning scheme. Likewise, the article 
[Preparing Your App](/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/publish/preparing-your-app) 
helps you determine which files to upload. 

To start uploading, click *Browse* and select the files that make up your app. 
Each time you add a file, it automatically begins to upload and its 
compatibility information is scanned. You must upload at least one file before 
advancing beyond this screen. Once the files are successfully uploaded, a check 
mark appears next to each plugin, and the plugins are displayed based on their 
compatibility information.

In case you wish to upload the source code of your app, you can use the Upload Source Code link. This will be available as a separate download for Liferay Marketplace users.

If you selected *Free* for your app pricing, click *Next* to advance to the 
final screen. If you selected *Paid*, you'll be presented with additional 
options for licensing and pricing your app.
