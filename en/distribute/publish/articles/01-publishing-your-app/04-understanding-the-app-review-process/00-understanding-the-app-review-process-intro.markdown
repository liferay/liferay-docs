# Understanding the App Review Process

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Liferay Marketplace app QA/review process begins as soon as you submit your
app for review. Every third-party app submitted to the Liferay Marketplace is
reviewed by our team to ensure that certain standards for information are upheld
and the app installs as expected. *Liferay cannot, however, be a substitute for
your own testing and debugging team*. Ultimately, you must test, refine, and
ensure that your app functions as promised and performs as expected.

| **Note:** Liferay is not responsible for the behavior (or misbehavior) of apps
| on the Marketplace. For details regarding this, consult the *Liferay Marketplace
| User Agreement*, *Liferay Marketplace Developer Agreement*, and the individual
| *End User License Agreements* associated with each app.

Once you've submitted your app for review, your app's status changes as it moves
through the review process. We email you on status changes and provide as much
detail as we can if we discover potential issues with your app. Overall, we
don't want our app review process to feel like a barrier or a black box. We love
having new apps in the Marketplace, and we try to be as helpful as we can
throughout the approval process!

If you submit an updated version of a previously approved app, you'll see these
statuses: Approved (Version Unsubmitted), Approved (Version Pending), Approved
(Version Pending QA), and Approved (Version Denied).

The app review process consists of **Two Major Phases**:

                    Liferay does not do source code review and does not ask for
                    your source code. Further, Liferay is not responsible for
                    the behavior (or misbehavior) of apps on the Marketplace.
                    Please consult the Liferay Marketplace User Agreement,
                    Liferay Marketplace Developer Agreement, and the individual

**Our QA Test Environments** are summarized below. At a minimum, test your app
against these environments prior to submission. If technical reasons prevent
your app from running on certain platforms (e.g., app server-specific issues),
specify compatibility in the app description and documentation so that our
review team can exclude certain test conditions, if necessary.

**\*** You can request certification on additional, optional application 
servers. For Liferay 7.x, Wildfly 10 is available. For Liferay 6.x, Glassfish
3.1 and an appropriate JBoss version are available. Please add the request in
the app submission panel's *Note to testers* section.

**\**** On 6.x versions, we test with JDK 7 unless otherwise directed.  On 7.x versions, we test on JDK 8 unless either otherwise directed or the app clearly encounters an issue with JDK 8, then we will test with JDK 11.

Once your app is approved by Marketplace staff, you'll get email notification.
When your app is approved, it is made available on Marketplace. The app also
appears on your public Profile page, which lists all apps that you or your
company developed and published.

If your app is rejected, you receive an email explaining the reasons for
rejection. You can then make the requested changes and re-submit the app for
approval.

After you've successfully published your app, you might get all kinds of
feedback from users and yourself about what's right and wrong with it. The next
article explores how to make changes once you have published your app.
