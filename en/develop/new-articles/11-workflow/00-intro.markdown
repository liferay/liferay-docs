# Approving Content with Workflow

In any application that accepts user created content, it's important to have an
approval process for publishing that content. Review and approval might be
necessary for a number of reasons:

-  Preventing the posting of illegal data
-  Ensuring that no objectionable content is published, such as profanity,
   images, or any other violation of the terms of use 
-  Protecting the quality of published content 

This Learning Path instructs the reader in workflow-enabling the Guestbook
App's `Guestbook` and `Entry` entities to ensure that only approved content is
published after review.
