# Using the Chart Taglib in Your Portlets

[TOC levels=1-4]

Lines, splines, bars, pies and more, the Chart tag Library provides everything
you need to model data. Each taglib gives you access to the corresponding
[Clay component](https://github.com/liferay/clay/tree/2.x-stable/packages/clay-charts/src).
These components contain the default configuration for the UI.

To use the Chart taglib in your apps, add the following declaration to your JSP:

    <%@ taglib prefix="chart" uri="http://liferay.com/tld/chart" %>

This section of tutorials covers the types of charts you can create with the
Chart taglibs. Each tutorial contains a set of chart examples along with sample
Java data and a figure displaying the rendered results.
