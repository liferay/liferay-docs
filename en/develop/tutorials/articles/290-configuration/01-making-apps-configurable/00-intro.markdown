# Making Applications Configurable

[TOC levels=1-4]

A configurable application allows a user with appropriate permissions to change
certain aspects of the application, within bounds set by the developer.
Liferay's configuration framework simplifies the task by auto-generating a UI if
you define the configuration options in a Java interface. This way, you don't
have to create your own application configuration framework.

Complete these three high level tasks to integrate your application with the
configuration framework:

1.  Provide a way to set configurations in the user interface.

2.  Set the scope at which the application can be configured.

3.  Read configuration values in your business logic.

This tutorial demonstrates both adding your application's configuration form to
the System Settings application in the Control Panel and categorizing the
configuration. Subsequent tutorials show you how to

1.  Set the *scope* of the configuration. Read more about configuration scope
    [here](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/system-settings#configuration-scope).

2.  Read configuration values from various contexts.

| **Note:** To see a working application configuration, deploy the
| `configuration-action`
| [Blade sample](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.1/gradle/apps/configuration-action)
| and navigate to System Settings (*Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr;
| *System Settings*). Go to *Platform* &rarr; *Third Party*. In the System Scope,
| open the *Message display configuration* entry and edit the fields as you wish.
|
| Add the *Blade Message Portlet* to a page to test your configuration choices.

You don't need much prior knowledge to use the configuration API, but
understanding a few key concepts is useful before diving into the code.

**Typed Configuration**
: The method described here uses *typed* configuration. The application
configuration isn't just a list of key-value pairs. Values can have types, like
`Integer`, a list of `Strings`, a URL, etc. You can even use your own types,
although that's beyond the scope of this tutorial. Typed configurations are
easier to use than untyped configurations, and they prevent many programmatic
errors. Configuration options should be programmatically explicit, so developers
can use autocomplete in modern IDEs to find out all configuration options of
a given application or one of its components.

**Modularity**
: Modern applications are *modular* and built as a collection of lightweight
[components](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/fundamentals#components).

**Configuration Scope**
: If your application must support different configurations at different scopes,
the APIs described below handle most of the burden for you. You should still
understand the term *configuration scope* even if you don't plan to scope the
application's configuration. Here are the most common configuration scopes:

   - *System* configurations are unique for the complete installation of
     the application.

   - *Virtual Instance* configurations can vary per virtual instance.

   - *Site* configuration can vary per site.

   - *Portlet Instance* configurations apply to a single application placed on a
     page (i.e., portlets). Each placement (instance) of the application on the
     page can have a different configuration.

Enough with the conceptual stuff. You're ready to get started with some code. If
you already had a portlet or service that was configurable using the traditional
mechanisms of Liferay Portal 6.2 and before, refer to the
[Transitioning from Portlet Preferences to the Configuration API](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/transitioning-from-portlet-preferences-to-the-configuration-api) tutorial.

## Creating A Configuration Interface

First, you'll learn how to create a configuration at the system scope.

1.  Create a Java interface to represent the configuration and its default
    values. Using a Java interface allows for an advanced type system for each
    configuration option. Here is the configuration interface for the Liferay
    Forms application:

        @Meta.OCD(
            id = "com.liferay.dynamic.data.mapping.form.web.configuration.DDMFormWebConfiguration",
            localization = "content/Language", name = "ddm-form-web-configuration-name"
        )
        public interface DDMFormWebConfiguration {

            @Meta.AD(
                deflt = "1", description = "autosave-interval-description",
                name = "autosave-interval-name", required = false
            )
            public int autosaveInterval();

            @Meta.AD(
                deflt = "descriptive", name = "default-display-view",
                optionLabels = {"Descriptive", "List"},
                optionValues = {"descriptive", "list"}, required = false
            )
            public String defaultDisplayView();

        }

    It defines two configuration options, the autosave interval (with a default
    of one minute) and the default display view, which can be descriptive or
    list, but defaults to descriptive. Here's what the two Java annotations in
    the above snippet do:

    1.  **Meta.OCD:** Registers this class as a configuration with a specific id. **The
        ID must be the fully qualified configuration class name.**

    2.  **Meta.AD:** Specifies
        [optional metadata](http://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/210-metatype.html)
        about the field, such as whether it's a required field or if it has a default value.
        Note that if you set a field as required and don't specify a default value,
        the system administrator must specify a value in order for your application
        to work properly. Use the `deflt` property to specify a default value.

    The fully-qualified name of the `Meta` class above is
    `aQute.bnd.annotation.metatype.Meta`. For more information about this class and
    the `Meta.OCD` and `Meta.AD` annotations, please refer to the [bndtools
    documentation](http://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/210-metatype.html).

    The cool thing about configuration interfaces is that once you have one, you
    also have an auto-generated UI!

2.  To use the `Meta.OCD` and `Meta.AD` annotations in your modules, you must
    [specify a dependency](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/configuring-dependencies)
    on the bnd library. We recommend using bnd version 3. Here's an example of
    how to include this dependency in a Gradle project:

        dependencies {
            compile group: "biz.aQute.bnd", name: "biz.aQute.bndlib", version: "3.1.0"
        }

    | **Note:** The annotations `@Meta.OCD` and `@Meta.AD` are part of the bnd
    | library, but as of OSGi standard version R6, they're included in the OSGi core
    | under the names `@ObjectClassDefinition` and `@AttributeDefinition`. The OSGi
    | annotations can be used for simple cases like the one described in this
    | tutorial. However, a key difference between the two libraries is that the bnd
    | annotations are available at runtime, while the OSGi annotations are not.
    | Because runtime availability is necessary for some of the Liferay-specific features
    | described below, we recommend defaulting to the bnd annotations.

3.  Add the following line to your project's `bnd.bnd` file:

        -metatype: *

    This line lets bnd use your configuration interface to generate an XML
    configuration file. This provides a lot of information about your application's
    configuration options. Enough, in fact, to generate a
    [System Settings](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/system-settings) user
    interface automatically.

<!--[Figure 1: Navigate to the Control Panel and then click on *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*. Then click on *Platform* &rarr; *Third Party*, find the *Example configuration* link, and click on it.](../../images/example-configuration-system-settings.png)-->

Just by registering a configuration interface, you get a fully capable UI form
auto-generated in the System Settings application. By default, configurations
are placed in Platform &rarr; Third Party. Make it easier to find for your
application's users by categorizing the configuration somewhere logical. The
next tutorial show you how to do that.
