A Staged model is an essential building block to implementing the Staging and
Export/Import frameworks in your application. Instead of having to create staged
models for your app manually, you can leverage
[Service Builder](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/service-builder) to
generate the necessary staged model logic for you. Before diving into this
tutorial, make sure you've read the
[Understanding Staged Models](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/understanding-staged-models)
tutorial for information on how staged models work. Also, if your app doesn't
use Liferay's Service Builder, you must configure it in your project. If you
need help doing this, follow the
[Defining an Object-Relational Map with Service Builder](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/defining-an-object-relational-map-with-service-builder)
tutorial.

This tutorial assumes you have a Service Builder project with `*api` and
`*service` modules. If you want to follow along with this tutorial, download the
staged-model-example
Service Builder project. This is a bare-bones project that you can test to
observe the Staging-related changes generated by running Service Builder. This
tutorial assumes your project is built with Gradle. The example project's
`service.xml` file contains the following configuration:

    <service-builder package-path="com.liferay.docs">
        <namespace>FOO</namespace>
        <entity local-service="true" name="Foo" remote-service="true" uuid="true">

            <!-- PK fields -->

            <column name="fooId" primary="true" type="long" />

            <!-- Group instance -->

            <column name="groupId" type="long" />

            <!-- Audit fields -->

            <column name="companyId" type="long" />
            <column name="createDate" type="Date" />
            <column name="modifiedDate" type="Date" />

            ...
            ...

        </entity>
    </service-builder>

For simplicity, you'll track the Service Builder-generated changes applied to an
entity model file to observe how staged models are assigned to your entity. Keep
in mind the specific
[staged attributes](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/understanding-staged-models#important-attributes-in-staging)
necessary for each staged model. Depending on the attributes defined in your
`service.xml` file, Service Builder assigns your entity model to a specific
staged model type.

1.  Navigate to your project's `*service` module at the command line. Run
    Service Builder (e.g., `gradlew buildService`) to generate your project's
    models based on the current `service.xml` configuration.

2.  Open your project's `[Entity]Model.java` interface and observe the inherited
    interfaces.

        public interface FooModel extends BaseModel<Foo>, ShardedModel, StagedModel {

    Your model was generated as a staged model! This is because the UUID is set
    to `true` and the `companyId`, `createDate`, and `modifiedDate` columns are
    defined. There is much more logic generated for your app behind the scenes,
    but this shows that Service Builder deemed your entity eligible for the
    Staging and Export/Import frameworks.

3.  Add the `userId` and `userName` columns to your `service.xml` file:

		    <column name="userId" type="long" />
		    <column name="userName" type="String" />

4.  Rerun Service Builder and observe your `[Entity]Model.java` interface again:

        public interface FooModel extends BaseModel<Foo>, GroupedModel, ShardedModel,
            StagedAuditedModel {

    Your model is now a staged audited model!

5.  Add the `lastPublishDate` column to your `service.xml` file:

        <column name="lastPublishDate" type="Date" />

6.  Rerun Service Builder and observe your `[Entity]Model.java` interface again:

        public interface FooModel extends BaseModel<Foo>, ShardedModel,
            StagedGroupedModel {

    Your model is now a staged grouped model! The `groupId` column is also
    required to extend the `StagedGroupedModel` interface, but it was already
    defined in the original `service.xml` file.

Fantastic! You've witnessed firsthand how easy it is to generate staged models
using Service Builder.
