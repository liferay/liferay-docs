## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight?

This sample leverages the
[npm development workflow support](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/using-npm-in-your-portlets).

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component?

This sample uses the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) to download project
dependencies and uses the
[liferay-npm-bundler tool](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler)
to bundle the project dependencies inside the OSGi bundle JAR file.

To accomplish the bundling, the project's build process relies on a `build`
script inside its `package.json` file:

    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc && liferay-npm-bundler",
        "tsc": "tsc"
    },

## Where Is This Sample?

This sample is built with the following build tool:

There are three different versions of this sample, each built with a different
build tool:
