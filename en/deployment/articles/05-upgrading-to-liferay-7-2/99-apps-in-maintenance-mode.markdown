# Apps in Maintenance Mode

[TOC levels=1-4]

<aside class="alert alert-info">
  <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue120">This document has been updated and ported to <a href="https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/reference/maintenance-mode-and-deprecations-in-7-2.html">Liferay Learn</a> and is no longer maintained here.</span>
</aside>

At a designated time, Liferay may cease enhancing a product or capability. This
is called *maintenance mode*. During this mode, Liferay actively supports and
provides bug fixes for the product or capability in accordance with the
subscribers' subscription level and the end of service life policies of the
compatible Liferay DXP version. Maintenance mode does not necessarily mean that
deprecation in a future Liferay DXP version is planned for the product or
capability; it only means that enhancements aren't being made for the current
Liferay DXP development cycle.

As of Liferay DXP 7.2, these products and capabilities have transitioned into
maintenance mode:

-   Liferay Connected Services
-   Liferay Connector to OAuth 1.0a
-   Liferay Drools
-   Liferay Mobile Experience (Liferay Screens, Liferay Mobile SDK, Liferay Push)
-   Liferay Reports
-   Liferay Sync
