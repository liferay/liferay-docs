[TOC levels=1-4]

| **Note:** The following LCS features have been deprecated and removed in
| March 2020: Page Analytics, Fix Pack Management, and Portal Properties. Please
| read the
| [LCS Feature Deprecation Update](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037317691-Liferay-Connected-Services-Feature-Deprecation-Update-March-2020)
| to learn more about how you can prepare for these upcoming changes.

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of tools and services for managing your @product@ instances. LCS can help you activate your instances and manage your
subscriptions. In other words, LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is
@product@. Even better, the features of LCS work regardless of whether your
instance is on a single discreet server or distributed across a cluster. It's
like having a single butler that can serve several mansions at once!

Before going any further, you should take note of a few key terms used

**Project:** Represents a group of users belonging to a company or
organization. For example, a project can consist of all the users from a
project team or business unit, or it can include the entire company.

**Environment**: Represents a physical cluster of servers or a virtual or
logical aggregation of servers.

**Server**: Describes a concrete @product@ instance. It can be a standalone
server or a cluster node.
