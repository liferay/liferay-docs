### Creating Your Own Plugin Repository [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-creating-your-own-plugin-repository-0)

As your enterprise builds its own library of portlets for internal use, you can create your own plugin repository to make it easy to install and upgrade portlets. This will allow different departments who may be running different instances of Liferay to share portlets and install them as needed. If you are a software development house, you may wish to create a plugin repository for your own products. Liferay makes it easy for you to create your own plugin repository and make it available to others.

You can create your plugin repository in two ways:

1.  Use the Software Catalog in the control panel to create the repository by using its graphical interface and an HTTP server.

2.  Create an XML file using the Liferay Plugin Repository DTD (`http://www.liferay.com/dtd/liferay-plugin-repository_6_0_0.dtd`) and an HTTP server.

Both methods have their benefits. The first method allows users to upload their plugins to an HTTP server to which they have access. They can then register their plugins with the repository by adding a link to it via the control panel's graphical user interface. Liferay will then generate the XML necessary to connect the repository to a control panel running on another instance of Liferay. This XML file can then be placed on an HTTP server, and the URL to it can be added to the Plugin Installer, making the portlets in this repository available to the server running Liferay.

The second method does not require an instance of Liferay to be running. You can upload plugins to an HTTP server of your choice, and then create an XML file called `liferay-plugin-repository.xml` manually. If you make this file available on an HTTP server (it can be the same one which is storing the plugins or a different one), you can connect the repository to a Plugin Installer in the control panel running on an instance of Liferay.

We will first look at creating a plugin repository using the Software Catalog in the control panel.

<!-- section ii Software catalog (head ref)   -->

#### The Software Catalog [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-the-software-catalog-0)

You will want to use the Software Catalog if you will have multiple users submitting portlets into the repository, and if you don't want to worry about creating the `liferay-plugin-repository.xml` file yourself.

![Figure 9.22: The Software Catalog with Nothing Installed](../../images/marketplace-software-catalog.png)

Each site in your portal can have an instance of the Software Catalog. The control panel presents you with the software catalog for whichever site you are working on. This means that different sites can have different software repositories, so you can host several software repositories on the same instance of Liferay if you wish, they just have to be in different sites. Choose the site that will host the plugin repository and go to the control panel. You will see at the top of the screen a message that says “Content for [Site], where [Site] is the site you were on when you selected the control panel from the dockbar. If you want to administer the software catalog for a different site, you can select it from the selection box.

![Figure 9.23: Populated Software Catalog from liferay.com](../../images/marketplace-populated-software-catalog.png)

The Software Catalog has several tabs. The first tab is labeled Products. The default view of the portlet, when populated with software, displays what plugins are available for install or download. This can be seen in the version on Liferay's home page.

We will use an example site in order to better illustrate how to use the Software Catalog portlet. Assume you, as the portal administrator, have created a site called *Old Computers*. This site will be for users to collaborate on setting up and using old computers with obsolete hardware and operating systems. Users who participate in the site will eventually get upgraded to a more privileged status and get their own blog page. To implement this, you have created a My Summary portlet which displays the user's name, picture, and description from his or her user profile. Because this portlet is generic enough that it could be useful to anyone using Liferay, you have decided to make it available in your own software catalog.

The first step in adding a plugin to your software repository is to add a license for your product. A license communicates to users the terms upon which you are allowing them to download and use your software. Click the *Licenses* tab and then click the *Add License* button that appears. You will then see a form which allows you to enter the title of your license, a URL pointing to the actual license document, and check boxes denoting whether the license is open source, active, or recommended.

When you have finished filling out the form, click the *Save* button. Your license will be saved. Once you have at least one license in the system, you can begin adding software products to your software catalog. Click the *Products* tab, and then click the *Add Product* button.

Your next step will be to create the product record in the software catalog. This will register the product in the software catalog and allow you to start adding versions of your software for users to download and/or install directly from their instances of Liferay. You will first need to put the `.war` file containing your software on a web server that is accessible without authentication to the users who will be installing your software. In the example above, the *Old Computers* site is on the Internet, so you would place the file on a web server that is accessible to anyone on the Internet. If you are creating a software catalog for an internal Intranet, you would place the file on a web server that is available to anyone inside of your organization's firewall.

To create the product record in the Software Catalog portlet, click the *Products* tab, and then click the *Add Product* button. Fill out the form with information about your product.

![Figure 9.24: Adding a Product to the Software Catalog](../../images/marketplace-adding-product-to-software-catalog.png)

**Name:** The name of your software product.

**Type:** Select whether this is a portlet, theme, layout template, hook, or web plugin.

**Licenses:** Select the license(s) under which you are releasing this software.

**Author:** Enter the name of the author of the software.

**Page URL:** If the software has a home page, enter its url here.

**Tags:** Enter any tags you would like added to this software.

**Short Description:** Enter a short description. This will be displayed in the summary table of your software catalog.

**Long Description:** Enter a longer description. This will be displayed on the details page for this software product.

**Permissions:** Click the *Configure* link to set permissions for this software product.

**Group ID:** Enter a group ID. A group ID is a name space which usually identifies the company or organization that made the software. For our example, we will use *old-computers*.

**Artifact ID:** Enter an Artifact ID. The artifact ID is a unique name within the name space for your product. For our example, we will use *my-summary-portlet*.

**Screenshot:** Click the *Add Screenshot* button to add a screen shot of your product for users to view.

When you have finished filling out the form, click the *Save* button. You will be brought back to the product summary page, and you will see that your product has been added to the repository.

Notice that in the version column, *N/A* is being displayed. This is because there are not yet any released *versions* of your product. To make your product downloadable, you need to create a version of your product and point it to the file you uploaded to your HTTP server earlier.

Before you do that, however, you need to add a *Framework Version* to your software catalog. A Framework version denotes what version of Liferay your plugin is designed for and works on. You cannot add a version of your product without linking it to a version of the framework for which it is designed.

Why is this so important? Because as Liferay gains more and more features, you may wish to take advantage of those features in future versions of your product, while still keeping older versions of your product available for those who are using older versions of Liferay. This is perfectly illustrated in the example My Summary portlet we are using. Liferay had a My Summary portlet of its own, which does exactly what we have described here. This portlet was added to the suite of portlets which Liferay provides in the Social Networking plugin. This plugin makes use of the many social networking features which have been added to Liferay. So rather than just displaying a summary of your information, the Social Networking portlet adds features such as status updates, a "wall" for each user in his or her profile that other users can *write* on, the ability to become *friends* with other users—thereby granting them access to their profiles—and more.

None of this would work in older versions of Liferay, because the core engine that enables developers to create features like this is not there. So in this case, you would want to keep the older My Summary portlet available for users who have not yet upgraded, and make the newer social portlets available to those using latest version of Liferay. This is what *Framework Versions* does for you. If you connect to Liferay's software repositories with an old version of Liferay Portal, you will see the My Summary portlet. If you connect to Liferay's software repositories with new version of Liferay, you will see the social portlets.

So click the *Framework Versions* tab and then click the *Add Framework Version* button.

Give the framework a name, a URL, and leave the *Active* check box checked. For our example, we have entered 6.0.3 for the name, because our portlet should work on that version and higher, and [http://www.liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com) for the URL. Click *Save*.

![Figure 9.25: Adding a Product Version to the Software Catalog](../../images/marketplace-adding-product-version-software-catalog.png)

Now go back to the *Products* tab and click on your product. You will notice that a message is displayed stating that the product does not have any released versions. Click the *Add Product Version* button.

**Version Name:** Enter the version of your product.

**Change Log:** Enter some comments regarding what changed between this version and any previous versions.

**Supported Framework Versions:** Select the framework version for which your software product is intended. Enter a `+` at the end of the version number if you want to specify a version plus any future versions.

**Download Page URL:** If your product has a descriptive web page, enter its URL here.

**Direct Download URL (Recommended):** Enter a direct download link to your software product here. The Plugin Installer portlet will follow this link in order to download your software product.

**Include Artifact in Repository:** To enable others to use the Plugin Installer portlet to connect to your repository and download your plugin, select *yes* here.

When you are finished filling out the form, click the *Save* button. Your product version will be saved, and your product will now be available in the software repository.

##### Generating The Software Catalog [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-generating-the-software-catalog-0)

The Software Catalog works by generating an XML document which the Plugin Installer reads. Using the data from this XML document, the Plugin Installer knows where it can download the plugins from, what version of Liferay the plugins are designed for, and all other data about the plugins that have been entered into the Software Catalog portlet.

In order to get your Software Catalog to generate this XML data, you will need to access a particular URL. If you have created a friendly URL for your site (for example, the default site, which is called *guest*, has a friendly URL of `/guest` already configured for it), you can use the friendly URL. If not, you will first need to know the Group ID of the site in which your Software Catalog portlet resides. You can do this by accessing the Manage Pages interface and looking at the URLs for any of the pages. The URL will look something like this: `http://localhost:8080/web/10148/1`.

Obviously, it is much easier if you are using Friendly URLs, which we highly recommend.

Next, go to your browser and go to the following URL:

[http://<server name\>:<port number\>/software\_catalog?<Friendly URL name or Group ID\>](http://<server name\>:<port number\>/software\_catalog?<Friendly URL name or Group ID\>)

For example, if you are on the same machine as your Liferay instance, and that instance is running on port 8080, and your group ID from the database is 10148, you would use the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/software\_catalog?10148](http://localhost:8080/software\_catalog?10148)

If you have also created a friendly URL called *old-computers* for this site, you would use the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/software\_catalog?old-computers](http://localhost:8080/software\_catalog?old-computers)

If you have configured everything properly, an XML document should be returned:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?\>
	
	<plugin-repository\>
	
	<settings/\>
	
	<plugin-package\>
	
	<name\>My Summary</name\>
	
	<module-id\>old-computers/my-summary-portlet/1.0/war</module-id\>
	
	<modified-date\>Thu, 23 Apr 2009 20:40:16 +0000</modified-date\>
	
	<types\>
	
	<type\>portlet</type\>
	
	</types\>
	
	<tags\>
	
	<tag\>social</tag\>
	
	<tag\>profile</tag\>
	
	</tags\>
	
	<short-description\>My Summary</short-description\>
	
	<long-description\>My Summary</long-description\>
	
	<change-log\>Initial Version</change-log\>
	
	<download-url\>[http://www.liferay.com/portlets/my-summary-portlet-6.0.4.war](http://www.liferay.com/portlets/my-summary-portlet-5.2.2.war)
	
	</download-url\>
	
	<author\>Rich Sezov</author\>
	
	<screenshots/\>

	</licenses\>
	
	<liferay-versions/\>
	
	</plugin-package\>
	
	</plugin-repository\>

You can now give the URL to your software repository out on your web site, and other administrators of Liferay can enter it into the Plugins Installation module of their Liferay control panels to connect to your repository.

If you want to serve your repository off of a static web server, you can save this document to a file called `liferay-plugin-package.xml` and put this file on your HTTP server. You can then give out the URL to the directory which holds this file on your web site, and anyone with an instance of Liferay will be able to point their Plugin Installer portlets to it.

##### Benefits of the Software Catalog [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-benefits-of-the-software-catalog-0)

As you can see, the Software Catalog makes it easy for you to create a repository of your software. Users of Liferay can configure their Plugin Installers to attach to your repository, and the proper versions of your software will be automatically made available to them by a single click. This is by far the easiest way for you to keep track of your software, and for your users to obtain your software.

Another benefit of the Software Catalog is that by using it, you make available to your users a standard interface for manually downloading your software. For those who prefer to manually download plugins, your Software Catalog gives them an interface to go in, find your software either by browsing or by searching, preview screen shots, and download your software—and you don't have to build any of those pages yourself. Simply configure your software in the portlet, and all of that is done for you.

How can you do this? The Software Catalog is also available as a portlet. You can add it to any page on your web site through the *Add Application* menu. You can find the portlet in the *Tools* category.

#### Manually Creating A Software Catalog [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-manually-creating-a-software-catalog-0)

If you do not wish to use the control panel to create your software catalog, you can create it manually by manually typing out the XML file that the Software Catalog section of the control panel would normally generate. Note that if you do this, you will not be able to use the Software Catalog portlet as a graphical user interface to your software that end users can use to download your software manually: you will have to build this yourself. Keep in mind that many instances of Liferay Portal sit behind a firewall without access to the Internet. Because of this, if you are making your software available to Internet users, some of them will have to download it manually anyway, because their installations are firewalled. In this case, the Software Catalog portlet is the easiest way to provide a user interface for downloading your software.

If you still wish to use a text editor to create your software catalog, you can. To manually create a software catalog, obtain the DTD for the XML file from Liferay's source code. You will find this DTD in the *definitions* folder in the Liferay source. It is a file called `liferay-plugin-package_6_0_0.dtd`. Use this DTD with a validating XML editor (a good, free choice is jEdit with all the XML plugins) to create your software catalog manually.

#### Connecting to a Software Catalog [](id=lp-6-1-ugen15-connecting-to-a-software-catalog-0)

If there is a software catalog of plugins that you would like to point your instance of Liferay to, all you need is the URL to the catalog. Once you have the URL, go to the Plugin Installer in your control panel and click the *Configuration* tab. You will see that there are two fields in which you can enter URLs to plugin repositories: *Trusted Plugin Repositories* and *Untrusted Plugin Repositories*. Currently, the only difference between the two is to provide a visual cue for administrators as to which repositories are trusted and untrusted.

Enter the URL to the repository to which you wish to connect in one of the fields and click *Save*. The portlet will connect to the repository, and items from this repository will be shown in the list.

<!-- Section v Knowledge Base [](id=knowledge-base) --> 
## Knowledge Base [](id=knowledge-base)

Liferay's Knowledge Base portlet provides a means for creating and organizing articles within a site. The knowledge base is perfect for creating and organizing information more formally than in a wiki. For example, it can be used to organize and display professional product documentation. It's easy to set up the knowledge base with a workflow that requires articles to be approved before they are published. Additionally, it allows administrators to create article templates. Templates can be used to insure that certain kinds of articles possess a common structure and include certain kinds of information. Knowledge base articles can be categorized to make them easy to find. They can also be organized hierarchically to form complete books or guides. The Knowledge Base portlet is available as an app from Liferay Marketplace. Please see chapter 2 for installation instructions.

### Knowledge Base Display Portlet [](id=lp-6-1-ugen04-knowledge-base-display-portlet-0)

The Knowledge Base app actually consists of four portlets that can be placed on site pages as well as one that adds a page to the control panel. The four portlets that can be placed on a page are Knowledge Base (Display), Knowledge Base Search, Knowledge Base Article, and Knowledge Base Section. When placed on a page, the Knowledge Base display portlet presents many of the same options to an administrator that are available from the Knowledge Base page of the control panel.

![Figure 4.23: Knowledge Base Display Portlet](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-display-portlet.png)

You can use the four links at the top of the Knowledge Base display portlet to control what it displays.

*Knowledge Base Home:* shows you a list of all top level articles.

*Recent Articles:* shows you a list of articles in order from most recent activity to least recent activity.

*Administrator:* shows you a list of all articles, regardless of which ones are parents or children of the others.

*My Subscriptions:* shows you a list of articles you are subscribed to.

The *Add Article* button is available from the Knowledge Base Home or Administrator view of the Knowledge Base display portlet or from the Articles tab of the Knowledge Base page of the control panel. Use this button to create an article for the knowledge base. When creating an article, you can use the same WYSIWYG editor that you used to create wiki pages. Articles, however, are not the same as wiki pages: they must be created in HTML, not MediaWiki or Creole. Click the *Source* button in the editor to view the HTML source of what you've written or write some HTML yourself.

![Figure 4.24: New Knowledge Base Article](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-new-article.png)

In addition to entering a title and creating content for your article, you can use the editor to add attachments, add tags, and set permissions. By default, view permission is granted to the guest role, meaning that anyone can view your article. After you're done using the editor, you can save it as draft and continue working on it later, or you can submit it for publication. Your article may need to be approved before being published, depending on the workflow defined for your portal.

You can find the *Permissions* button next to the Add Article button in the Knowledge Base display portlet or on the Knowledge Base page of the control panel. Click this button to define permissions that apply to the Knowledge Base display portlet generally, not to particular articles. Here, you can define which roles can add articles and templates, which are granted knowledge base administrator privileges, which can change permissions on articles, which can subscribe to articles, and which can view templates. 

![Figure 4.25: Knowledge Base Permissions](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-permissions.png)

Users may need to be granted access to the knowledge base page of the control panel in order to exercise some of the above permissions. For example, suppose that the user role has been granted the Add Article and the View Templates permissions. A user will be able to add articles from the knowledge base display portlet but will need access to the knowledge base page of the control panel in order to view templates. Note that the Knowledge Base (Display) permissions are distinct from the Knowledge Base (Admin) portlet. The display permissions define what a user can do with the Knowledge Base display portlet on a page while the admin permissions define what a user can do on the Knowledge Base page of the control panel.

### Knowledge Base Page of the Control Panel [](id=lp-6-1-ugen04-knowledge-base-page-of-the-control-panel-0)

The Knowledge Base page of the control panel has two tabs: one for articles and one for templates. The articles tab shows all the articles in the knowledge base and lets you perform actions on them. The templates tab shows all the templates defined in the knowledge base and lets you perform actions on them.

![Figure 4.26: Knowledge Base Control Panel Page](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-control-panel.png)

Administrators can perform the following actions on an article:

*View:* displays an article. From here, you can add a child article, edit the article, change its permissions, move it, or delete it.

*Edit:* allows you to change the title and content of an article as well as add attachments, select topics, and add tags.

*Permissions:* lets you configure the permissions on a specific article.

*Subscribe:* lets you to choose to be notified of any updates to a particular article.

*Move:* lets you change an article's position in the hierarchy by choosing a new parent article for it.

*Delete:* lets you remove an article from the knowledge base.

These actions are similar to the ones that can be performed from the Administrator view of the Knowledge Base display portlet. However, the Knowledge Base display portlet is intended to be placed on a page for the end user so an additional action is available: *RSS* is a link to an RSS feed of an article. Also, the *View* action is only available from the control panel since the Knowledge Base Article portlet can be used to display an article on a page.

The templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of the control panel allows administrators to create templates to facilitate the creation of articles. A template basically functions like a starting point for the creation of certain types of articles. Click the *Add Template* button on the Templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of the control panel to create a new template. 

![Figure 4.27: Adding a New Template From the Control Panel](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-new-template.png)

Navigate back to the templates tab of the Knowledge Base page of the control panel. You can perform the following actions on a template:

*View:* displays a template. From here, you can use the template to create an article, edit the template, modify the permissions on the template, or delete it. 

*Edit:* allows you to change the title and content of a template.

*Permissions:* allows you to configure the permissions on a template. You can choose roles to have permission to update, view, delete, or change the permissions on templates.

*Delete:* lets you remove a template from the knowledge base.

To use a template to create a new article, you have view the template and then click *Use this Template*. This brings you to the New Article editor with the contents of the template copied for you.

### Knowledge Base Article Portlet [](id=lp-6-1-ugen04-knowledge-base-article-portlet-0)

The Knowledge Base Article portlet can be placed on a page to display a an entire article. When you first place this portlet on a page it displays the message *Please configure this portlet to make it visible to all users*. This message is a link to the configuration dialog box for the portlet. Click *Select Article* to choose an article to display. Pick an article and then click *Save*. When your page refreshes it will display the article in the portlet. 

![Figure 4.28: Knowledge Base Article Portlet](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-article-portlet.png)

The Knowledge Base Article portlet allows users to rate and comment on the article it displays. There are also links at the top of the portlet that users can use to subscribe to an RSS feed of the knowledge base, subscribe to the article, view the history of the article, or print the article.

### Knowledge Base Section Portlet [](id=lp-6-1-ugen04-knowledge-base-section-portlet-0)

The Knowledge Base Section portlet allows administrators to selectively show articles associated with a specific section. For example, a news site might have a *World* section, a *Politics* section, a *Business* section, and an *Entertainment* section. In order to use sections, you need to set the `admin.kb.article.sections` property in your knowledge base portlet's `portlet.properties` file and redeploy the portlet. You can find the `portlet.properties` file in the knowledge base portlet's source directory. Updating the one in your server's directory won't work. Use comma delimited section names to set the property, like `admin.kb.article.sections=World,Politics,Business,Entertainment`, for example. 

Once you have defined some sections in your knowledge base's `portlet.properties` file, your users will see a multi-select box in the Add Article and Edit Article screens that allows them to select which section an article belongs to. You can add any number of Knowledge Base section portlets to a page and you can configure each portlet to display articles from any number of sections.

![Figure 4.29: Knowledge Base Section Portlets](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-section-portlet.png)

The Knowledge Base section portlet has some additional configurations that allow an administrator to select a display style (title or abstract), an article window state (maximized or normal), how to order the articles, how many articles to display per page, and whether or not to show pagination.

### Knowledge Base Navigation [](id=lp-6-1-ugen04-knowledge-base-navigation-0)

Wikis often have deeply nested articles that can be hard to find by browsing. Liferay's knowledge base's ability to selectively display articles makes it easier to browse than a Wiki. The knowledge base also features some other aids to navigation. The Knowledge Base Search portlet allows you to search for articles in the knowledge base. This portlet presents the search results to you in order from most relevant to least relevant. 

![Figure 4.30: Knowledge Base Search Portlet](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-search-portlet.png)

You can also use the Categories Navigation portlet in conjunction with the Knowledge Base display portlet. When both of these portlets are placed on a page you can select a topic in the Categories Navigation portlet and the Knowledge Base display portlet will show all of the articles that match the topic. You can create topics from the Categories page of the control panel.

![Figure 4.31: Knowledge Base Category Navigation Portlet](../../images/liferay-collaboration-kb-catnavandkbdisplay-portlets.png)

You can select topics for articles when you are creating or editing them. Next, let's take a look at the Documents and Media library, Liferay's general mechanism for creating and storing files in the portal.
