# Administering Liferay Portal [](id=administering-liferay-portal)

You know how all these retailers want to advertise themselves as a "one stop shop" for whatever it is that you want? The idea is that they have so much stuff that chances are that whatever you're looking for is there. Liferay's control panel is something like this. If you want to create users, sites, organizations, configure permissions and plugins, and pretty much anything else, you'll do it with the control panel. The nice thing about the control panel is that it makes all this very easy to do. This chapter takes all the concepts you learned about Liferay in chapter 1 (sites, organizations, and more) and makes them concrete. Here, you'll learn how to create and manage every aspect of Liferay's configuration. 

This chapter covers the following activities:

-   Using the control panel to manage users, organizations, sites, user groups, roles, and teams

-   Using the control panel to manage password policies, authentication settings, mail host names, email notifications, display settings, and monitoring

-   Using the control panel to manage server administration, portal instances, plugins, and updates

Let's begin our examination of Liferay's control panel by looking at how to manage and organize users in Liferay Portal.

<!-- Section i  Managin users (head ref)-->
## Managing Users, User Groups, Organizations, Sites, Teams, and Roles [](id=managing-users-user-groups-organizations-sites-teams-and-roles)

The Portal section of the control panel is used for most administrative tasks. You'll find there an interface for the creation and maintenance of

- Users, User Groups, and Organizations

- Sites and Teams

- Site Templates

- Page Templates

- Roles

Additionally, you can configure many server settings, including:

- Password Policies

- Portal Settings

- Custom Fields

- Monitoring

- Plugins Configuration

You'll use the Portal section of the control panel to create your portal structure, implement security, and administer your users. Configurable portal settings include mail host names, email notifications, and authentication options including single sign-on and LDAP integration. Note that only users with the administrator role, which is a portal scoped role, have permission to view this section of the control panel. You can, of course, grant custom roles permissions to one or more sections.

### Adding users [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-adding-users-0)

Let's add a user account for yourself and configure this account so that it has the same administrative access as the default administrator account. Go up to the Dockbar, mouse over *Go to* and click *Control Panel*. Then open the *Users and Organizations* page under the *Portal* category. Click the *Add* button and select *User*. Fill out the Add User form using your name and email address. When you are finished, click *Save*.

![Figure 12.1: The Add User Screen](../../images/01-add-user-screen.png)

After you submit the form, the page reloads with a message saying that the save was successful. An expanded form appears that allows you to fill out a lot more information about the user. You don't have to fill anything else out right now. Just note that when the user ID was created, a password was automatically generated and, if Liferay was correctly installed (see chapter 11), an email message with the password in it was sent to the user. This, of course, requires that Liferay can properly communicate with your SMTP mail server.

![Figure 12.2: Liferay's User Account Editor](../../images/01-user-account-editor.png)

If you haven't yet set up your mail server, you'll need to use this page to change the default password for the user ID to something you can remember. You can do this by clicking on the *Password* link in the box on the right, entering the new password in the two fields, and clicking *Save*. Next, you should give your user account the same administrative rights as the default administrator's account. This allows you to perform administrative tasks with your own ID instead of having to use the default ID. It also helps to make your portal more secure by deleting or disabling the default ID.

Click the *Roles* link. The control panel's Roles page shows the roles to which your ID is currently assigned. You should have one role: Power User. By default, all users are assigned the Power User role. You can give this role certain permissions if you wish or disable it altogether. You can also define the default roles a new user receives. We'll see how to do this later.

To make yourself an Administrator, click the *Select* link. A dialog box pops up with a list of all the roles in the system. Select the Administrator role from the list. The dialog box disappears and the role is added to the list of roles associated with your account. Next, click the *Save* button, which is at the bottom of the blue bar of links on the right. You are now an administrator of the portal. Log out of the portal and then log back in with your own user ID.

We'll next look at some aspects of user management. 

### User management [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-user-management-0)

If you click the *Users* link on the left menu of the control panel, there are now two users in the list of users. If you want to change something about a particular user, you can click the *Actions* button next to that user.

**Edit User:** takes you back to the Edit User page, where you can modify anything about the user.

**Permissions:** allows you to define which roles have permissions to edit the user.

**Manage Pages:** allows you to edit the personal pages of a user.

**Impersonate User:** opens another browser window which allows you to browse the site as if you were the user.

**Deactivate:** deactivates the user's account.

Note that most users can't perform most of the above actions. In fact, most users won't even have access to this section of the control panel. You can perform all of the above functions because you have administrative access.

Let's look next at how to manage organizations. 

<!--  this is Section i, subsection a   -->
### Organizations [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-managing-organizations-0)

Organizations are used to represent hierarchical structures such as those of companies, non-profit organizations, churches, schools, and clubs. They have been used to represent a sports league, with various sports (soccer, baseball, basketball, etc.) and their teams as sub-organizations. If you have a collection of users that fit into a hierarchical structure, you can model that as an organization.

Your portal design might not need organizations or it might have one or several, depending on your portal's function. For example, a simple photo-sharing web site could be powered by sites only (see below for information on sites). On the other hand, organizations are useful for corporations or educational institutions since their users can be placed easily into a hierarchical structure. In fact, organizations in Liferay are designed to model any group hierarchy, from those of government agencies all the way down to those of small clubs. Of course, your portal can use both organizations and independent sites. For example, a corporation or educational institution could create a social networking site open to all portal users, even ones from separate organizations. 

Organizations and suborganizations can be created in a hierarchy to unlimited levels, and users can be members of one or many organizations. These organizations can all reside in a single hierarchy or cut across different hierarchies. Note that the rights of an organization administrator apply both to his/her organization and to any child organizations. By default, members of child organizations are members of the parent organizations. This behavior can be customized in your portal's `portal-ext.properties` configuration file.

Additionally, Organizations can be associated with roles. One application of this in a corporate setting might be an IT Security group. You could have a suborganizaton of your IT organization that handles security for all of the applications company-wide. If you grant the IT Security organization the same administrator role you just gave to your own ID, all members of the organization would have administrative access to the portal. Suppose now that a user in this organization later was hired by the Human Resources department. The simple act of removing the user from the IT Security organization also removes the user's administrative privileges, since the privilege came from the IT Security group's role. By adding the user to the HR organization, any roles the HR organization has (such as access to a benefits system in the portal) are transferred to the user. In this manner, you can design your portal to correspond with your existing organization chart, and users' permissions are granted according to their positions in the chart.

Of course, this is only one way to design it. If you have more complex requirements, you can combine organizations with teams and scoped roles to assemble the sets of permissions you wish to grant to particular users. But we'll get to that. Let's first see how to manage organizations. 

To add an organization, click the *Users and Organizations* link on the left side of the control panel. Then click the *Add* button and choose *Regular Organization*. 

Does your organization need to have its own web site? Most organizations don't, but some do, and Liferay provides this ability by attaching a site to an organization. To attach a site when you create an organization, click the *Organization Site* tab at the right, and check the *Create Site* box. If you don't know right now if your organization needs a web site, that's fine: you can always add one later if the need arises. 

![Figure 12.3: Adding an organization](../../images/01-add-organization-screen.png)

**Name:** Enter a name for the organization.

**Type:** Choose whether this is a regular organization or a location. A location cannot have any suborganizations.

**Parent Organization:** Select an organization in the system to be the direct parent of the organization you are creating. Click the *Remove* button to remove the currently configured parent.

---

![tip](../../images/01-tip.png) **Tip:** Note that you're already a member of any organizations that you create. By creating an organization, you become both a member and receive the Organization Owner role, which gives you full rights to the organization. You can, of course, add other users to this role to make them Organization Owners. 

---

Fill out the information for your organization and click *Save*. As before with users, the form reappears and you can enter more information about the organization. Organizations can have multiple email addresses, postal addresses, web sites, and phone numbers associated with them. The Services link can be used to indicate the operating hours of the organization, if any.

For now, click the *Back* button. This takes you back to the list of organizations.

Click the *Actions* button next to the new organization you created. This shows the actions you can take to manipulate this organization.

**Edit:** lets you specify details about the organization, including addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and websites.

**Manage Site:** lets you create and manage public and private pages for the organization's site.

**Assign Organization Roles:** lets you assign organization-scoped roles to users. By default, Organizations are created with three roles: Organization Administrator, Organization User, and Organization Owner. You can assign one or more of these roles to users in the organization. All members of the organization automatically get the Organization User role so this role is hidden when you click Assign Organization Roles.

**Assign Users:** lets you search and select users in the portal to be assigned to this organization as members.

**Add User:** adds a new user in the portal and assigns the user as a member of this organization.

**Add Regular Organization:** lets you add a child organization to this organization. This is how you create hierarchies of organizations with parent-child relationships.

**Add Location:** lets you add a child Location, which is a special type of organization that cannot have any children added to it.

**Delete:** deletes this organization from the portal. You must ensure that the organization has no users in it first.

If you click the *View* button at the top of the Users and Organizations page and select *View Hierarchy* you can view both a list of users who are members of this organization and a list of all the suborganizations of this organization.

We briefly mentioned sites during this discussion. Sites are another construct within the portal, and have different properties than organizations. Let's see how you can use them. 

<!-- needs transition -->

<!--  this is Section i, subsection b   -->
### User Groups [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-user-groups-0)

User Groups are arbitrary groupings of users. These groups are created by portal administrators to group users together who don't necessarily share an obvious hierarchical attribute. Users can be assigned to multiple user groups. User Groups are most often used to achieve one of the following goals:

- Simplify the assignment of several roles to a group of users. For example, in a University portal, a user group could be created to group all teachers independently of their organization to make it easier to assign one or several roles at once to all the teachers.
- Simplify membership to one or more sites by specifying a group of users. Using the previous example, all teachers could be members of the sites *University Employees* and *Students and Teachers Collaboration Site* by adding the *Teachers* user group as a member.
- Provide predefined public or private pages to the users that belong to the user group. For example, the *Teachers* user group could be created to ensure that the home page on all teachers' personal sites has the same layout and applications.

Creating a user group is easy. Navigate to the control panel, click the *Users Groups* link, and then click the *Add* button. There are only two fields to fill out: Name and Description. Click *Save* and you will be redirected back to the *User Groups* page of the control panel.

![Figure 12.11: Creating a New User Group](../../images/server-configuration-new-user-group.png)

Note in the figure above how each user group may have a site, with public and private pages. This is a special type of site that determines the base pages on all user group members' personal sites. The user group site works in a similar way to Site Templates, except that in this case the the User Group Site pages are not copied for each user, but are rather shown dynamically along with any custom pages that the user may have on his/her personal site. For this reason, users are not allowed to make any modifications to the pages that are *inherited* from the user group. Alternatively the administrators of the user group can define certain areas as customizable, just like they can for regular sites. This allows users to decide which applications they want to place in certain areas of each page, as well as change their configuration.

![Figure 12.12: User Group Actions](../../images/01-editing-a-user-group.png)

As with the other resources in the portal, you can click the *Actions* button next to a user group to perform various operations on that group.

**Edit:** allows you to modify the name or description of the user group.

**Permissions:** lets you define which roles have permissions to view, edit, delete, assign members to the user group, etc.

**Site Permissions:** lets you define which roles have permissions to manage the user group site, to specify who can administer its pages, export and import pages and portlet content, manage archived setups, and configure its applications. 

**Manage Site Pages:** allows you to add pages to the user group site, import or export pages, organize the page hierarchy, modify the look and feel of the pages, add a logo, or access other options from the Manage Site interface.

**Assign Members:** lets you search for and select users in the portal to be assigned to this user group as well as view the users currently belonging to the user group .

**Delete:** deletes the user group.

If your user group has a site, two options named **Go to the Site's Public Pages** and **Go to the Site's Private Pages** also appear as links in your user group's Actions menu. Clicking one of these links opens the user group's site in a new browser window. Any changes you make to the site are saved automatically. You can safely close the browser window when you're done.

##### Creating and editing a User Group [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-creating-and-editing-a-user-group-0)

A user group's site can be administered from the control panel. Select *User Groups* from the control panel to see a list of existing user groups. To edit a user group, click on its name or description. You can also click on the *Actions* button to see the full list of actions that can be performed on a user group. When editing a user group, you can view its site, if it exists, by clicking the *Open Pages* link under Public Pages or Private Pages (read below for details on user group sites).

As an example of how user group sites can be used, let's create a user group called *Bloggers* along with a simple template. We'll call the site template *Bloggers* too. It should contain a single *Blog* page with the Blogs and Recents Bloggers portlets on it. First, navigate to the User Groups page of the control panel. Then click *Add* and enter the name *Bloggers* for your user group, and optionally, a description. Click *Save* to create your user group.

Our next step is to assign an existing user to the *Bloggers* group.

##### Assigning Members to a User Group [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-assigning-members-to-a-user-group-0)

Navigate to *Users and Organizations* and create a new user called *Joe Bloggs*. Then navigate to the User Groups page of the control panel and click *Actions* &rarr; *Assign Members* next to the Bloggers group. Click the *Available* tab to see a list of users that can be assigned to the group.

![Figure 12.13: Assigning Members to a User Group](../../images/01-adding-members-to-user-group.png)

From that list, one or more users can be selected to be assigned as members of the user group.

For example, by default, newly created users are given *Welcome* pages on the public pages portion of their personal sites. This Welcome page contains the Language, Search, and Blogs portlets. You can see the effect of the *Bloggers* site template on the public pages of Joe Bloggs's personal site in the figure above. When Joe Bloggs was added to the *Bloggers* group, he received a *Blogs* page with the *Blogs* and *Recent Bloggers* portlets.

After the user group has been created and several users have been added to it, you can add all those users at once as members of a site in one step from the *Site Memberships* UI of the site. You can also use the user group when assigning a role to users from the roles management UI.

The next section describes a more advanced usage of user groups: User Group Sites.

#### User Group Sites [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-user-group-sites-0)

Liferay allows users to each have a personal site consisting of public and private pages. Permissions can be granted to allow users to customize their personal sites at will. Originally, the default configuration of those pages could only be determined by the portal administrator through the `portal-ext.properties` file and, optionally, by providing the configuration in a LAR file. You can still configure it like this, but it isn't very flexible or easy to use.

By using User Group Sites, portal administrators can add pages to the personal sites of all the users who belong to the site in an easy and centralized way. All the user group site's public pages are shown as part of the user's public personal site. All the user group site's private pages are shown as part of the user's private site. If a user belongs to several user groups, all of its pages are made part of his public and private site. In an educational institution's portal, for example, teachers, staff, and students could get different default pages and applications on their personal sites.

The pages that a user personal site *inherits* from a User Group still belong to the User Group and thus cannot be changed in any way by the users. What the user group administrators can do is define certain areas of the pages as customizable to allow the users to choose which applications and what configuration should be shown in those areas. If a user has permission to add custom pages to his/her personal site, besides those *inherited* from a user group, the custom pages are always shown last.

Since the *inheritance* of pages is done dynamically, this new system introduced in Liferay 6.1 can scale to hundreds of thousands of users or even millions of them without an exponential impact in performance. Previous versions of Liferay used a different technique that required that the user group pages were copied to each user's personal site. For portals upgrading from previous versions of Liferay, you can keep the old behavior, but it has been left disabled by default. You can enable it by adding the following line to your portal-ext.properties file:

	user.groups.copy.layouts.to.user.personal.site=true

When this property is set to true, once the template pages have been copied to a user's personal site, the copies may be modified by the user. Changes done to the originals in the User Group will only affect new users added to the user group. Users with administrative privileges over their personal sites can modify the pages and their content provided that the *Allow Site Administrators to Modify the Pages Associated with This Site Template* box has been checked for the template. When a user is removed from a user group, the associated pages are removed from the user's personal site. Moreover, if a user is removed from a group and is subsequently added back, the group's template pages are copied to the user's site a second time. Note that if a user group's site is based on a site template and an administrator modifies the user group's site template after users have already been added to the group, those changes only take effect if the *Enable propagation of changes from the site template* box for the user group was checked.

---

![tip](../../images/01-tip.png) **Tip:** Previous to Liferay 6.1, pages from different user groups could be combined on users' personal sites by using a naming convention. Liferay 6.1 simplifies the way user groups' sites work by disallowing page combination. Set the property *user.groups.copy.layouts.to.user.personal.site* to true if you depend on that functionality.

---

You can create a user group's site manually or base it on a site template. To create a user group's site manually, use the *Actions* menu mentioned above and choose *Manage Site Pages*. You can add a new public or private page by selecting the appropriate tab and then clicking the *Add Page* button. Once the user group has at least one public or private page in place, you can go back to the *Actions* menu and click on the *Go to the Site's Public Pages* or *Go to the Site's Private Pages* link to open the user group's site in a new browser window. In the new window, you can add more pages and portlets and configure site settings.

You can also base a user group's site on a template. When editing a user group, use the Public Pages and Private Pages drop down lists to select a site template. Leave the *Enable propagation of changes from the site template* box checked to automatically update users' personal sites if the associated site template changes. If you uncheck this box but recheck it later, the template pages are copied to the users' sites, overwriting any changes they may have made. You can allow users to make changes to the pages they receive from the user group by enabling the customization options on each page.

This flexibility lets you achieve almost any desired configuration for a user's personal site without having to modify it directly. When a user is assigned to a user group, the configured site pages are copied directly to the user's personal site.

Following with the example above, we will create a site for our sample user group. Edit the *Bloggers* group. Choose an existing Site Template from the drop down menu for the user group's public pages and click *Save*. After the page reloads you can click to see the pages and make any changes desired, add additional pages, etc.

![Figure 12.14: Selecting a Template for the User Group Site](../../images/user-group-site-template-selected.png)

Also, try visiting the public site of one of the users that belong to the user group. You will see how all of the pages in the user group appear as part of the user site, including the ones copied from the site template and the ones added afterwards.

<!--  this is Section i, subsection c   -->
### Roles and Permissions [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-roles-0)

Roles are groupings of users that share a particular function within the portal, according to a particular scope. Roles can be granted permissions to various functions within portlet applications. You can think of a role as a description of a function, such as Message Board Administrators. A role with that name is likely to have permissions relevant to the specific Message Board portlets delegated to it. Users who are placed in this role will inherit these permissions.

The roles page of the control panel serves as a single interface which lets you create roles, assign permissions to them, and assign users to the roles. Roles can be scoped by portal, site, or organization. To create a role, click the *Roles* link, and then click the *Add* button. You can choose a Regular, Site, or Organization role. A regular role is a portal-scoped role. Make a selection and then type a name for your role, a title, and a description. The name field is required but the title and description are optional. If you enter a name and a title, the title will be displayed in the list of roles on the Roles page of the control panel. If you do not enter a title, the name will be displayed. When you have finished, click *Save*.

![Figure 12.15: Roles Page and Role Actions Menu](../../images/01-roles-and-role-actions.png)

After you save, Liferay redirects you to the list of roles. To see what functions you can perform on your new role, click the *Actions* button.

**Edit:** lets you change the name, title, or description of the role.

**Permissions:** allows you to define which users, user groups, or roles have permissions to edit the role.

**Define Permissions:** defines what permissions this role grants. This is outlined in the next section.

**Assign Members:** lets you search and select users in the portal to be assigned to this role. These users will inherit any permissions that have been assigned to this role.

**View Users:** allows you to view the users who have been assigned to this role.

**Delete:** permanently removes a role from the portal.

Next, let's examine how to configure the permissions granted by different roles.

#### Defining Permissions on a Role [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-defining-permissions-on-a-role-0)

Roles serve as repositories of permissions to be assigned to users who belong to them. So, to use a role, you need to assign members to it and define the permissions that you want to grant to members of the role.

![Figure 12.16: Defining Permissions on a Role](../../images/01-defining-permissions-on-a-role.png)

When you click the *Actions* button on portal-scoped role and select *Define Permissions*, you will be shown a list of all the permissions that have been defined for that role. Click the *Add Permissions* drop-down menu to see a list of the permissions that can be defined. As of Liferay version 6.1, these permissions fall into seven categories: Portal, Site Content, Site Application, Control Panel: Personal, Control Panel: Site, Control Panel: Portal, and Control Panel: Server. For non-portal scoped roles, you need to click on the *Options* link on individual portlets, then *Configuration*, then *Permissions* to assign permissions within the site or organization that owns the portlet. 

Portal permissions cover portal-wide activities that comprise several categories, such as site, organization, location, password policy, etc. This allows you to create a role that, for example, can create new sites within the portal. This would allow you to grant users that particular permission without making them overall portal administrators.

Site Content permissions cover the content that the installed portlets create. If you pick one of the portlets from this list, you'll get options for defining permissions on its content. For example, if you pick Message Boards, you'll see permissions for creating categories or threads, or deleting and moving topics.

Site Application permissions affect the application as a whole. So, using our Message Boards example, an application permission might define who can add the Message Boards portlet to a page.

The control panel permissions affect how the portlet appears to the user in the control panel. Some control panel portlets have a Configuration button, so you can define who gets to see that, as well as who gets to see an application in the control panel.

![Figure 12.17: Message Board Content Permissions](../../images/01-message-board-content-permissions.png)

Each possible action to which permissions can be granted is listed. To grant a permission, check the box next to it. If you want to limit the scope of the permission to a particular site, click the *Limit Scope* link, and then choose the site. Once you have chosen the permissions granted to this role, click *Save*. For a portal-scoped Message Boards Administrator role, you might grant content permissions for every action listed. After you click *Save*, you will see a list of all permissions that are currently granted to this role. From here, you can add more permissions or go back by clicking a link in the breadcrumb list or the *Return to Full Page* link.

Roles are very powerful, and allow portal administrators to define various permissions in whatever combinations they like. This gives you as much flexibility as possible to build the site you have designed.

#### Special Note about the Power Users Role [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-special-note-about-the-power-users-role-0)

Prior to Liferay 6.0, the default configurations of many Liferay portlets allowed power users, but not regular users, to access them. Liferay 6.0 and subsequent versions grant the same default permissions to both power users and regular users. This way, portal administrators are not forced to use the power users role. However, Liferay encourages those who do to create their own custom permissions for the role. 

---

![tip](../../images/01-tip.png) Note: Prior to Liferay version 6.0, Power Users and Users did *not* have the same default permissions. So if are using Liferay 5.2 or a previous version, it's dangerous to remove the Power Users role from the default user associations: this could remove certain permissions that you expect to apply to all users. If you decide to remove the Power Users role from the default user associations anyway, you will probably want to modify the permissions on certain portlets to make them accessible to all users. To do this, see the section on Plugins Configuration below.

## Managing Portal Settings [](id=managing-portal-settings)

After you have created users, user groups, organizations, roles, sites, and teams, your portal will be ready to host content and applications. You can configure Liferay's portal settings to fit your environment and your particular portal project. Many configurations can be performed through Liferay's portlet-driven user interface. This section covers how to configure portal settings such as password policies, authentication settings, mail host names, email notifications, display settings, and monitoring.

Now that you have been navigating in the control panel, you should be pretty familiar with how it works. All the options appear in the left navigation, their interfaces appear in the middle, and any sub-options appear on the right. We have focused so far on the maintenance of users and portal security. The remaining links in the *Portal* category focus on various portal settings which cover how the portal operates and integrates with other systems you may have. Let's begin our discussion of Liferay's portal settings by examining how to configure password policies.

<!--  this is Section i, subsection d  -->
### Password Policies [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-password-policies-0)

Password policies can enhance the security of your portal. You can set requirements on password strength, frequency of password expiration, and more. Additionally, you can apply different password policies to different sets of portal users.

If you are viewing a page other than the control panel, select *Control Panel* from the *Go to* menu of the Dockbar. Next, click on the *Password Policies* link on the left side of the screen under the *Portal* heading. You will see that there is already a default password policy in the system. You can edit this in the same manner as you edit other resources in the portal: click *Actions* and then click *Edit*.

The Password Policy settings form contains the following fields. Enabling specific settings via the check boxes prompts setting-specfic options to appear.

**Name:** requires you to enter a name for the password policy.

**Description:** lets you describe the password policy so that other administrators will know what it's for.

**Changeable:** determines whether or not a user can change his or her password.

**Change Required:** determines whether or not a user must change his or her password after logging into the portal for the first time.

**Minimum Age:** lets you choose how long a password must remain in effect before it can be changed.

**Reset Ticket Max Age:** determines how long a password reset link remains valid.

**Password Syntax Checking:** allows you to set a minimum password length and to choose whether or not dictionary words can be in passwords. You can also specify detailed requirements such as minimum numbers of alpha numeric characters, lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or symbols.

**Password History:** lets you keep a history (with a defined length) of passwords and prevents users from changing their passwords to one that was previously used.

**Password Expiration:** lets you choose how long passwords can remain active before they expire. You can select the age, the warning time, and a grace limit.

**Lockout:** allows you to set a number of failed log-in attempts that triggers a user's account to lock. You can choose whether an administrator needs to unlock the account or if it becomes unlocked after a specific duration.

From the list of password policies, you can perform several other actions.

**Edit:** brings you to the form above and allows you to modify the password policy.

**Permissions:** allows you to define which users, user groups, or roles have permission to edit the password policy.

**Assign Members:** takes you to a screen where you can search and select users in the portal to be assigned to this password policy. The password policy will be enforced for any users who are added here.

**Delete:** shows up for any password policies that you add beyond the default policy. You cannot delete the default policy.

Next, let's examine Liferay's Portal Settings.

<!-- (JR) start here 19jan2012 -->

### Portal Settings [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-portal-settings-0)

Most global portal settings can be configured from the Portal Settings section of the control panel. The Configuration heading contains the following links:

**General:** lets you configure global settings, such as the company name, domain, the virtual host, a global portal logo, and more.

**Authentication:** allows you to configure log in IDs, connection to LDAP, and Single Sign-On.

**Users:** has three tabs, labeled Fields, Reserved Credentials, and Default User Associations. The Fields tab enables or disables some user fields, such as birthday or terms of use. The Reserved Credentials tab lets you reserve screen names and email addresses so that users cannot register using them. You might use this to prevent users from registering on the portal with user names that contain profanity or that sound official, such as *admin* or *president*. The Default User Associations tab lets you configure default membership to roles, user groups, and sites for new users, and provides a check box which allows you to retroactively apply these to existing users.

**Mail Host Names:** lets you add a list of other mail host names to be associated with your organization. For example, your main domain might be `mycompany.com`, but you might use `mycompany-marketing.com` for your email newsletters. Any domain names associated with your organization can go here.

**Email Notifications:** allows you to configure Liferay to send email notifications for certain events, such as user registrations, password changes, etc. You can customize those messages here.

![Figure 12.19: Portal Settings Pages](../../images/server-configuration-portal-settings-pages.png)

Let's discuss these settings next.

#### General [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-general-0)

The General link takes you to a page with three headings: Main Configuration, Navigation, and Additional Information. Under the Main Configuration heading, you can set the name of the company, organization, or site which is running the portal. This name also defines the name of your portal's default site. Its default name is `liferay.com`, so you will definitely want to set this to reflect your own company. You can also set the mail domain, virtual host, and content delivery network address here. Under the Navigation heading, you can set a home page for your portal here as well as default landing and logout pages. Under the Additional Information heading, you can specify a Legal name, ID, and type for your company, an SIC code, a ticker symbol, and industry, and a type.

#### Authentication [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-0)

The Authentication page has several tabs: General, LDAP, CAS, Facebook, NTLM, OpenID, Open SSO, and SiteMinder. You can use any of these authentication methods to configure how users will authenticate to Liferay. Since Liferay supports quite a few authentication methods, there are different settings for each.

The settings on the General tab of the Authentication page affect only Liferay functionality, and don't have anything to do with the integration options on the other tabs. The General tab allows you to customize Liferay's standard authentication behavior. Specifically, the General tab allows you to select from several global authentication settings:

-   Authenticate via email address (default), screen name, or user ID (a numerical ID auto-generated in the database not recommended).

-   Enable/Disable automatic log in. If enabled, Liferay allows a user to check a box which will cause the site to "remember" the user's log in by placing a cookie on his or her browser. If disabled, users will always have to log in manually.

-   Enable/Disable forgotten password functionality.

-   Enable/Disable request password reset links.

-   Enable/Disable account creation by strangers. If you are running an Internet site, you will probably want to leave this on so that visitors can create accounts on your site.

-   Enable/Disable account creation by those using an email address in the domain of the company running the site (which you just set on the General page of Portal Settings). This is handy if you are using Liferay to host both internal and external web sites. You can make sure that all internal IDs have to be created by administrators, but external users can register for IDs themselves.

-   Enable / Disable email address verification. If you enable this, Liferay will send users a verification email with a link back to the portal to verify that the email address they entered is a valid one they can access.

By default, all settings except for the last are enabled. User authentication by email address is an important default for the following reasons:

1.  An email address is, by definition, unique to the user who owns it.

2.  People can generally remember their email addresses. If you have  user who hasn't logged into the portal for a while, it is possible that he or she will forget his or her screen name, especially if the user was not allowed to use his or her screen name of choice (because somebody else already used it).

3.  If a user changes his or her email address, it is more likely that the user will forget to update his or her email address in his or her profile, if that email address is not used to authenticate. If the user's email address is not updated, all notifications sent by the portal will fail to reach the user. So it is important to keep the email address at the forefront of a user's mind when he or she logs in to help the user keep it up to date. 

We'll examine how to set up LDAP authentication next.

### LDAP [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-ldap-0)

You can use the LDAP tab of the Authentication page to connect Liferay to an LDAP directory. There are two places for you to configure the LDAP settings: here in the control panel or in the `portal-ext.properties` file (which is covered in chapter 14). We recommend that you use the control panel since your configuration settings will be stored in the database. Note that if you use both, the settings in the database will override the settings in `portal-ext.properties`. Configuring the LDAP settings from the control panel is easier and does not require a restart of Liferay. The only compelling reason to use the `portal-ext.properties` file is if you have many Liferay nodes which will be configured to run against the same LDAP directory. In that case, for your initial deployment, it may be easier to copy the `portal-ext.properties` file to all of the nodes so that the first time they start up, the settings are correct. Regardless of which method you use, the available settings are the same.

You configure the global values from the LDAP tab of the Authentication page.

**Enabled:** Check this box to enable LDAP Authentication.

**Required:** Check this box if LDAP authentication is required. Liferay will then not allow a user to log in unless he or she can successfully bind to the LDAP directory first. Uncheck this box if you want to allow users with Liferay accounts but no LDA accounts to log in to the portal.

**LDAP Servers:** Liferay supports connections to multiple LDAP servers. You can you the Add button beneath this heading to add LDAP servers. We explain how to configure new LDAP servers below.

**Import/Export:** You can import and export user data from LDAP directories using the following options:

* *Import Enabled:* Check this box to cause Liferay to do a mass import from your LDAP directories. If you want Liferay to only synchronize users when they log in, leave this box unchecked. Definitely leave this unchecked if you are working in a clustered environment. Otherwise, all of your nodes would try to do a mass import when each of them starts up.

* *Import on Startup Enabled:* Check this box to have Liferay run the import when it starts up. Note: This box only appears if you check the *Import Enabled* box above.

* *Export Enabled:* Check this box to enable Liferay to export user accounts from the database to LDAP. Liferay uses a listener to track any changes made to the `User` object and will push these changes out to the LDAP server whenever the `User` object is updated. Note that by default on every login, fields such as `LastLoginDate` are updated. When export is enabled, this has the effect of causing a user export every time the user logs in. You can disable this by setting the following property in your `portal-ext.properties` file:

    users.update.last.login=false

**Use LDAP Password Policy:** Liferay uses its own password policy by default. This can be configured on the Password Policies page of the control panel. Check the *Use LDAP Password Policy* box if you want to use the password policies defined by your LDAP directory. Once this is enabled, the Password Policies tab will display a message stating that you are not using a local password policy. You will now have to use your LDAP directory's mechanism for setting password policies. Liferay does this by parsing the messages in the LDAP controls that are returned by your LDAP server. By default, the messages in the LDAP controls that Liferay is looking for are the messages that are returned by the Fedora Directory Server. If you are using a different LDAP server, you will need to customize the messages in Liferay's `portal-ext.properties` file, as there is not yet a GUI for setting this. See below for instructions describing how to do this.

Once you've finished configuring LDAP, click the *Save* button. Next, let's look at how to add LDAP servers.

###### Adding LDAP Servers [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-adding-ldap-servers-0)

The Add button beneath the LDAP servers heading allows you to add LDAP servers. If you have more than one, you can arrange the servers by order of preference using the up/down arrows. When you add an LDAP Server, you will need to provide several pieces of data so that Liferay can bind to that LDAP server and search it for user records. Regardless of how many LDAP servers you add, each server has the same configuration options.

**Server Name:** Enter a name for your LDAP server.

**Default Values:** Several leading directory servers are listed here. If you are using one of these, select it and click the Reset Values button. The rest of the form will be populated with the proper default values for that directory.

**Connection:** These settings cover the basic connection to LDAP.

* *Base Provider URL:* This tells the portal where the LDAP server is located. Make sure that the machine on which Liferay is installed can communicate with the LDAP server. If there is a firewall between the two systems, check to make sure that the appropriate ports are opened.

* *Base DN:* This is the Base Distinguished Name for your LDAP directory. It is usually modeled after your organization. For a commercial organization, it may look similar to this: `dc=companynamehere,dc=com`.

* *Principal:* By default, the administrator ID is populated here. If you have removed the default LDAP administrator, you will need to use the fully qualified name of the administrative credential that you use instead. You need an administrative credential because Liferay will be using this ID to synchronize user accounts to and from LDAP .

* *Credentials:* This is the password for the administrative user.

This is all you need in order to make a regular connection to an LDAP directory. The rest of the configuration is optional. Generally, the default attribute mappings provide enough data to synchronize back to the Liferay database when a user attempts to log in. To test the connection to your LDAP server, click the *Test LDAP Connection* button.

If you are running your LDAP directory in SSL mode to prevent credential information from passing through the network unencrypted, you will have to perform extra steps to share the encryption key and certificate between the two systems.

For example, assuming your LDAP directory happens to be Microsoft Active Directory on Windows Server 2003, you would take the following steps to share the certificate:

On the Windows 2003 Domain Controller, open the *Certificates* MMC snapin. Export the Root Certificate Authority certificate by selecting *Certificates (Local Computer) mmc snapin &rarr; Trusted Root Certification Authorities &rarr; MyRootCACertificateName*. Right click this certificate and select *All Tasks &rarr; export &rarr; select DER encoded binary X.509 .CER*. Copy the exported `.cer` file to your Liferay Portal server.

As with the CAS install (see the below section entitled Single Sign-On), you will need to import the certificate into the *cacerts keystore*. The import is handled by a command like the following:

    keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore
    /some/path/jdk1.5.0_11/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
    -noprompt
    -alias MyRootCA -file /some/path/MyRootCA.cer

The *keytool* utility ships as part of the Java SDK.

Once this is done, go back to the LDAP page in the control panel. Modify the LDAP URL in the Base DN field to the secure version by changing the protocol to `https` and the port to `636` like the following:

    ldaps://myLdapServerHostname:636

Save the changes. Your Liferay Portal will now use LDAP in secure mode for authentication.

**Users:** This section contains settings for finding users in your LDAP directory.

* *Authentication Search Filter:* The search filter box can be used to determine the search criteria for user logins. By default, Liferay uses users' email addresses for their login names. If you have changed this setting, you will need to modify the search filter here, which has been configured to use the email address attribute from LDAP as a search criterion. For example, if you changed Liferay's authentication method to use screen names instead of the email addresses, you would modify the search filter so that it can match the entered log in name:

    (cn=@screen_name@)

* *Import Search Filter:* Depending on the **LDAP** server, there are different ways to identify the user. Generally, the default setting (`objectClass=inetOrgPerson`) is fine, but if you want to search for only a subset of users or users that have different object classes, you can change this.

* *User Mapping:* The next series of fields allows you to define mappings from LDAP attributes to Liferay fields. Though your LDAP user attributes may be different from LDAP server to LDAP server, there are five fields that Liferay requires to be mapped in order for the user to be recognized. You must define a mapping to the corresponding attributes in LDAP for the following Liferay fields:

    +   *Screen Name*

    +   *Password*

    +   *Email Address*

    +   *Full Name*

    +   *First Name*

    +   *Middle Name*

    +   *Last Name*

    +   *Job Title*

    +   *Group*

The control panel provides default mappings for commonly used LDAP attributes. You can also add your own mappings if you wish.

* *Test LDAP Users:* Once you have your attribute mappings set up (see above), click the *Test LDAP Users* button, and Liferay will attempt to pull LDAP users and match them with their mappings as a preview.

![Figure 12.20: Testing LDAP Users](../../images/server-configuration-testing-ldap-users.jpg)

**Groups:** This section contains settings for mapping LDAP groups to Liferay.

* *Import Search Filter:* This is the filter for finding LDAP groups that you want to map to Liferay. Enter the LDAP group attributes that you want retrieved for this mapping. The following attributes can be mapped:

    + Group Name

    + Description

    + User

* *Test LDAP Groups:* Click the **Test LDAP Groups** to display a list of the groups returned by your search filter.

**Export:** This section contains settings for exporting user data from LDAP.

* *Users DN:* Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the users will be stored. When Liferay does an export, it will export the users to this location.

* *User Default Object Classes:* When a user is exported, the user is created with the listed default object classes. To find out what your default object classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as JXplorer to locate a user and view the Object Class attributes that are stored in LDAP for that user.

* *Groups DN:* Enter the location in your LDAP tree where the groups will be stored. When Liferay does an export, it will export the groups to this location.

* *Group Default Object Classes:* When a group is exported, the group is created with the listed default object classes. To find out what your default object classes are, use an LDAP browser tool such as *Jxplorer* to locate a group and view the Object Class attributes that are stored in LDAP for that group.

![Figure 12.21: Mapping LDAP Groups](../../images/server-configuration-mapping-ldap-groups.jpg)

Once you've set all your options and tested your connection, click *Save*. From here, you can add another LDAP server or set just a few more options that apply to all of your LDAP server connections.

###### LDAP Options Not Available in the GUI [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-ldap-options-not-available-in-the-gui-0)

Although most of the LDAP configuration can be done from the control panel, there are several configuration parameters that are only available by editing `portal-ext.properties`. These options will be available in the GUI in future versions of Liferay Portal, but for now they can only be configured by editing the properties file.

If you need to change any of these options, copy the LDAP section from the `portal.properties` file into your `portal-ext.properties` file. Note that since you have already configured LDAP from the GUI, any settings from the properties file that match settings already configured in the GUI will be ignored. The GUI, which stores the settings in the database, always takes precedence over the properties file.

    ldap.auth.method=bind
    #ldap.auth.method=password-compare

Set either bind or password-compare for the LDAP authentication method. Bind is preferred by most vendors so that you don't have to worry about encryption strategies. Password compare does exactly what it sounds like: it reads the user's password out of LDAP, decrypts it, and compares it with the user's password in Liferay, syncing the two.

    ldap.auth.password.encryption.algorithm=
    ldap.auth.password.encryption.algorithm.types=MD5,SHA

Set the password encryption to used to compare passwords if the property `ldap.auth.method` is set to `password-compare`.

    ldap.import.method=[user,group]

If you set this to `user`, Liferay will import all users from the specified portion of the LDAP tree. If you set this to `group`, Liferay will search all the groups and import the users in each group. If you have users who do not belong to any groups, they will not be imported.

    ldap.error.password.age=age
    ldap.error.password.expired=expired
    ldap.error.password.history=history
    ldap.error.password.not.changeable=not allowed to change
    ldap.error.password.syntax=syntax
    ldap.error.password.trivial=trivial
    ldap.error.user.lockout=retry limit

These properties are a list of phrases from error messages which can possibly be returned by the LDAP server. When a user binds to LDAP, the server can return *controls* with its response of success or failure. These controls contain a message describing the error or the information that is coming back with the response. Though the controls are the same across LDAP servers, the messages can be different. The properties described here contain snippets of words from those messages, and will work with Red Hat's Fedora Directory Server. If you are not using that server, the word snippets may not work with your LDAP server. If they don't, you can replace the values of these properties with phrases from your server's error messages. This will enable Liferay to recognize them. Next, let's look at the Single Sign-On solutions that Liferay supports.


<!--  this is Section ii, subsection b  -->
### SSO [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-single-sign-on-0)

Single Sign-On solutions allow you to provide a single login credential for multiple systems. This allows you to have people authenticate to the Single Sign-On product and they will be automatically logged in to Liferay and to other products as well.

Liferay supports several single sign-on solutions. Of course, if your product is not yet supported, you may choose to implement support for it yourself by use of the extension environment. Alternatively, your organization can choose to sponsor support for it. Please contact `sales@liferay.com` for more information about this.

##### Authentication: Central Authentication Service (CAS) [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-central-authentication-service-cas-0)

CAS is an authentication system that was originally created at Yale University. It is a widely-used open source single sign-on solution, and was the first SSO product to be supported by Liferay.

Please follow the documentation for CAS to install it on your application server of choice.

Your first step will be to copy the CAS client .jar file to Liferay's library folder. On Tomcat, this is in `[Tomcat Home]/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib`. Once you've done this, the CAS client will be available to Liferay the next time you start it.

The CAS Server application requires a properly configured Secure Socket Layer certificate on your server in order to work. If you wish to generate one yourself, you will need to use the `keytool` utility that comes with the JDK. Your first step is to generate the key. Next, you export the key into a file. Finally, you import the key into your local Java key store. For public, Internet-based production environments, you will need to either purchase a signed key from a recognized certificate authority (such as Thawte or Verisign) or have your key signed by a recognized certificate authority. For Intranets, you should have your IT department pre-configure users' browsers to accept the certificate so that they don't get warning messages about the certificate.

To generate a key, use the following command:

    keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -keyalg RSA

Instead of the password in the example (`changeit`), use a password that you will be able to remember. If you are not using Tomcat, you may want to use a different alias as well. For First and Last names, enter `localhost`, or the host name of your server. It cannot be an IP address.

To export the key to a file, use the following command:
    
    keytool -export -alias tomcat -keypass changeit -file server.cert

Finally, to import the key into your Java key store, use the following command:

    keytool -import -alias tomcat -file %FILE_NAME% -keypass changeit
    -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts

If you are on a Windows system, replace `$JAVA_HOME` above with `%JAVA_HOME%`. Of course, all of this needs to be done on the system on which CAS will be running.

Once your CAS server is up and running, you can configure Liferay to use it. This is a simple matter of navigating to the *Settings &rarr;  Authentication &rarr; CAS* tab in the control panel. Enable CAS authentication, and then modify the URL properties to point to your CAS server.

**Enabled:** Check this box to enable CAS single sign-on.

**Import from LDAP:** A user may be authenticated from CAS and not yet exist in the portal. Select this to automatically import users from LDAP if they do not exist in the portal.

The rest of the settings are various URLs, with defaults included. Change *localhost* in the default values to point to your CAS server. When you are finished, click *Save*. After this, when users click the *Sign In* link, they will be directed to the CAS server to sign in to Liferay.

##### Authentication: Facebook [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-facebook-0)

Liferay Portal also enables users to log in using their Facebook accounts. To enable this feature, you simply need to select the *Enable* box and enter the Application ID and Application Secret which should have been provided to you by Facebook. Facebook SSO works by taking the primary Facebook email address and searching for the same email address in Liferay's `User_` table. If a match is found, the user is automatically signed on (provided that user clicked *allow* from the Facebook dialog). If there isn't a match, the user is prompted in Liferay to add a user from Facebook. Once selected, a new user is created by retrieving four fields from Facebook (first name, last name, email address, and gender).

##### Authentication: NTLM [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-ntlm-0)

NTLM is a Microsoft protocol that can be used for authentication through Microsoft Internet Explorer. Though Microsoft has adopted Kerberos in modern versions of Windows server, NTLM is still used when authenticating to a workgroup. Liferay Portal now supports NTLM v2 authentication. NTLM v2 is more secure and has a stronger authentication process than NTLMv1.

**Enabled:** Check this box to enable NTLM authentication.

**Domain Controller:** Enter the IP address of your domain controller. This is the server that contains the user accounts you want to use with Liferay.

**Domain:** Enter the domain / workgroup name.

**Service Account:** You need to create a service account for NTLM. This account will be a computer account, not a user account.

**Service Password:** Enter the password for the service account.

##### Authentication: OpenID [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-openid-0)

OpenID is a new single sign-on standard which is implemented by multiple vendors. The idea is that multiple vendors can implement the standard, and then users can register for an ID with the vendor they trust. The credential issued by that vendor can be used by all the web sites that support OpenID. Some high profile OpenID vendors are AOL [http://openid.aol.com/screenname](http://openid.aol.com/screenname), LiveDoor [http://profile.livedoor.com/username](http://profile.livedoor.com/username), and LiveJournal [http://username.livejournal.com](http://username.livejournal.com/). Please see the OpenID site [http://www.openid.net](http://www.openid.net/) for a more complete list.

A main benefit of OpenID for the user is that he or she no longer has to register for a new account on every site in which he or she wants to participate. Users can register on *one* site (the OpenID provider's site) and then use those credentials to authenticate to many web sites which support OpenID. Many web site owners often struggle to build communities because end users are reluctant to register for so many different accounts. Supporting OpenID makes it easier for site owners to build their communities because the barriers to participating (i.e., the effort it takes to register for and keep track of many accounts) are removed. All of the account information is kept with the OpenID provider, making it much easier to manage this information and keep it up to date.

Liferay Portal can act as an OpenID consumer, allowing users to automatically register and sign in with their OpenID accounts. Internally, the product uses OpenID4Java [http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/](http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/) to implement the feature.

OpenID is enabled by default in Liferay, but can be disabled here.

##### Atlassian Crowd [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-atlassian-crowd-0)

Atlassian Crowd is a web-based Single Sign-On product similar to CAS. Crowd can be used to manage authentication to many different web applications and directory servers.

Because Atlassian Crowd implements an OpenID producer, Liferay works and has been tested with it. Simply use the OpenID authentication feature in Liferay to log in using Crowd.

##### Authentication: OpenSSO [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-opensso-0)

OpenSSO is an open source single sign-on solution that comes from the code base of Sun's System Access Manager product. Liferay integrates with OpenSSO, allowing you to use OpenSSO to integrate Liferay into an infrastructure that contains a multitude of different authentication schemes against different repositories of identities.

You can set up OpenSSO on the same server as Liferay or a different box. Follow the instructions at the OpenSSO site [http://opensso.dev.java.net](http://opensso.dev.java.net/) to install OpenSSO. Once you have it installed, create the Liferay administrative user in it. Users are mapped back and forth by screen names. By default, the Liferay administrative user has a screen name of *test*, so in OpenSSO, you would register the user with the ID of *test* and an email address of *test@liferay.com*. Once you have the user set up, log in to Open SSO using this user.

In the same browser window, go to the URL for your server running Liferay and log in as the same user, using the email address *test@liferay.com*. Go to the control panel and click *Settings &rarr; Authentication &rarr; OpenSSO*. Modify the three URL fields (Login URL, Logout URL, and Service URL) so that they point to your OpenSSO server (i.e., only modify the host name portion of the URLs), click the *Enabled* check box, and then click *Save*. Liferay will then redirect users to OpenSSO when they click the *Sign In* link.

##### Authentication: SiteMinder [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-authentication-siteminder-0)

SiteMinder is a single sign-on implementation from Computer Associates. Liferay 5.2 introduced built-in integration with SiteMinder. SiteMinder uses a custom HTTP header to implement its single sign-on solution.

To enable SiteMinder authentication in Liferay, check the *Enabled* box on the *SiteMinder* tab. If you are also using LDAP with Liferay, you can check the *Import from LDAP* box. If this box is checked, user authenticated from SiteMinder that do not exist in the portal will be imported from LDAP.

The last field defines the header SiteMinder is using to keep track of the user. The default value is already populated. If you have customized the field for your installation, enter the custom value here.

When you are finished, click *Save*. Next, let's examine how to configure portal-wide user settings.

#### Users [](id=lp-6-1-ugen12-users-0)

The Users page of Portal Settings has three tabs: Fields, Reserved Credentials, and Default User Associations.

The Fields tab allows you to enable/disable the following fields:

-   Enable/disable requiring the Terms of Use

-   Enable/disable user screen names autogeneration

-   Enable/disable requiring the last names

-   Enable/disable the birthday field

-   Enable/disable the gender field

The next tab is Reserved Credentials. You can enter screen names and email addresses here that you don't want others to use. Liferay will then prevent users from registering with these screen names and email addresses. You might use this feature to prevent users from creating IDs that look like administrative IDs or that have reserved words in their names.

The Default User Associations tab has three fields allowing you to list (one per line) sites, roles, and user groups that you want new users to become members of automatically. By default, Liferay assigns new users to both the Users role and the Power Users role.

If you have defined other user groups, sites, or roles that you want newly created users to be members of by default, enter them here. For example, you may have defined site templates in certain user groups to pre-populate end users' private pages. If there is a particular configuration that you want everyone to have, you may want to enter those user groups here.
